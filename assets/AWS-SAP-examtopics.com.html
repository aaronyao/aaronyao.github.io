                You'll terminate the SSL at ELB. and the web request will get unencrypted to the EC2 instance, even if the certs are stored in S3, it has to be configured on the web servers or load balancers somehow, which becomes difficult if the keys are stored in S3. However, keeping the keys in the cert store and using IAM to restrict access gives a clear separation of concern between security officers and developers. Developers personnel can still configure SSL on ELB without actually handling the keys.

            You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas. The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS.<br>During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the database.<br>The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a<br>PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage.<br>The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors.<br>The business plan requires a deployment of at least 100K sensors which needs to be supported by the backend. You also need to store sensor data for at least two years to be able to compare year over year<br>Improvements.<br>To secure funding, you have to make sure that the platform meets these requirements and leaves room for further scaling.<br>Which setup win meet the requirements?<br>

                The POC solution is being scaled up by 1000, which means it will require 72TB of Storage to retain 24 months worth of data. This rules out RDS as a possible DB solution which leaves you with Redshift.<br>I believe DynamoDB is a more cost effective and scales better for ingest rather than using EC2 in an auto scaling group.<br>Also, this example solution from AWS is somewhat similar for reference. http:// media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_timeseriesprocessing_16.p df

            Your firm has uploaded a large amount of aerial image data to S3. In the past, in your on-premises environment, you used a dedicated group of servers to oaten process this data and used Rabbit MQ - An open source messaging system to get job information to the servers. Once processed the data would go to tape and be shipped offsite. Your manager told you to stay with the current design, and leverage AWS archival storage and messaging services to minimize cost.<br>Which is correct?<br>

            You've been hired to enhance the overall security posture for a very large e-commerce site. They have a well architected multi-tier application running in a VPC that uses ELBs in front of both the web and the app tier with static assets served directly from S3. They are using a combination of RDS and DynamoOB for their dynamic data and then archiving nightly into S3 for further processing with EMR. They are concerned because they found questionable log entries and suspect someone is attempting to gain unauthorized access.<br>Which approach provides a cost effective scalable mitigation to this kind of attack?<br>

            Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence.<br>The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads.

            <span class="answer-description">
                ElastiCache for Memcached -<br>The primary goal of caching is typically to offload reads from your database or other primary data source. In most apps, you have hot spots of data that are regularly queried, but only updated periodically. Think of the front page of a blog or news site, or the top 100 leaderboard in an online game. In this type of case, your app can receive dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of requests for the same data before it's updated again.<br>Having your caching layer handle these queries has several advantages. First, it's considerably cheaper to add an in-memory cache than to scale up to a larger database cluster. Second, an in-memory cache is also easier to scale out, because it's easier to distribute an in-memory cache horizontally than a relational database.<br>Last, a caching layer provides a request buffer in the event of a sudden spike in usage. If your app or game ends up on the front page of Reddit or the App Store, it's not unheard of to see a spike that is 10 to 100 times your normal application load. Even if you autoscale your application instances, a 10x request spike will likely make your database very unhappy.<br>Let's focus on ElastiCache for Memcached first, because it is the best fit for a cachingfocused solution. We'll revisit Redis later in the paper, and weigh its advantages and disadvantages.<br>Architecture with ElastiCache for Memcached -<br>When you deploy an ElastiCache Memcached cluster, it sits in your application as a separate tier alongside your database. As mentioned previously, Amazon ElastiCache does not directly communicate with your database tier, or indeed have any particular knowledge of your database. A simplified deployment for a web application looks something like this:<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0000800001.jpg" class="in-exam-image"><br>In this architecture diagram, the Amazon EC2 application instances are in an Auto Scaling group, located behind a load balancer using Elastic Load Balancing, which distributes requests among the instances. As requests come into a given EC2 instance, that EC2 instance is responsible for communicating with<br>ElastiCache and the database tier. For development purposes, you can begin with a single ElastiCache node to test your application, and then scale to additional cluster nodes by modifying the ElastiCache cluster. As you add additional cache nodes, the EC2 application instances are able to distribute cache keys across multiple<br>ElastiCache nodes. The most common practice is to use client-side sharding to distribute keys across cache nodes, which we will discuss later in this paper.<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0000900001.jpg" class="in-exam-image"><br>When you launch an ElastiCache cluster, you can choose the Availability Zone(s) that the cluster lives in. For best performance, you should configure your cluster to use the same Availability Zones as your application servers. To launch an ElastiCache cluster in a specific Availability Zone, make sure to specify the Preferred<br>Zone(s) option during cache cluster creation. The Availability Zones that you specify will be where ElastiCache will launch your cache nodes. We recommend that you select Spread Nodes Across Zones, which tells<br>ElastiCache to distribute cache nodes across these zones as evenly as possible. This distribution will mitigate the impact of an Availability Zone disruption on your ElastiCache nodes. The trade-off is that some of the requests from your application to ElastiCache will go to a node in a different Availability Zone, meaning latency will be slightly higher. For more details, refer to Creating a Cache Cluster in the Amazon ElastiCache User<br>Guide.<br>As mentioned at the outset, ElastiCache can be coupled with a wide variety of databases. Here is an example architecture that uses Amazon DynamoDB instead of Amazon RDS and MySQL:<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0001000001.jpg" class="in-exam-image"><br>This combination of DynamoDB and ElastiCache is very popular with mobile and game companies, because<br>DynamoDB allows for higher write throughput at lower cost than traditional relational databases. In addition,<br>DynamoDB uses a key-value access pattern similar to ElastiCache, which also simplifies the programming model. Instead of using relational SQL for the primary database but then key-value patterns for the cache, both the primary database and cache can be programmed similarly. In this architecture pattern, DynamoDB remains the source of truth for data, but application reads are offloaded to ElastiCache for a speed boost.

            You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 instance is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000 IOPS<br>(4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read and write performance. Sometime later, in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume is provisioned to 4,000 IOPs like the original four, for a total of 24,000 IOPS on the EC2 instance. Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all.<br>What is the problem and a valid solution?<br>
        </p>

                            The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized; use an EBSOptimized instance that provides larger throughput.

                            Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I/O throughput; configure the instance device driver and filesystem to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.

                            The standard EBS Instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate; change the instance root volume to also be a 500GB 4,000 Provisioned IOPS volume.

                            </span>

                            Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates; increase the provisioned volume storage of each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB.

                There is no such thing as "Most appropriate" without knowing all your goals. I find your scenarios very fuzzy, since you can obviously mix-n-match between them. I think you should decide by layers instead:<br>Load Balancer Layer: ELB or just DNS, or roll-your-own. (Using DNS+EIPs is slightly cheaper, but less reliable than ELB.)<br>Storage Layer for 17TB of Images: This is the perfect use case for S3. Off-load all the web requests directly to the relevant JPEGs in S3. Your EC2 boxes just generate links to them.<br>If your app already serves it's own images (not links to images), you might start with EFS. But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re-direct all JPEG links to S3 pretty easily.<br>If you use S3, don't serve directly from the bucket - Serve via a CNAME in domain you control. That way, you can switch in CloudFront easily.<br>EBS will be way more expensive, and you'll need 2x the drives if you need 2 boxes. Yuck.<br>Consider a smaller storage format. For example, JPEG200 or WebP or other tools might make for smaller images. There is also the DejaVu format from a while back.<br>Cache Layer: Adding CloudFront in front of S3 will help people on the other side of the world -- well, possibly.<br>Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won't be requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it can actually lower costs.)<br>You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static. This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right.<br>Database Layer: A few options:<br>Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road. Don't under- estimate this approach, sometimes it's better to start now and optimize later.<br><br>Use RDS to run MySQL/Postgres -<br>I'm not as familiar with ElasticSearch / Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance<br>+setup.<br>App Layer:<br>When creating the app layer from scratch, consider CloudFormation and/or OpsWorks. It's extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road.<br>Java+Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB).<br>Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public S3 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages.<br>If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to S3 that expire in a few hours. Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc.<br>Saving money: If you don't mind having downtime:<br>run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it's architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to be really robust. use Reduced Redundancy in S3 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to "go fix it" every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair S3.)<br>Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the RI market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It's just a coupon saying "if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs." You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily.<br>Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU - that way you can run on fewer/smaller boxes. (May or may not be worth the investment.)<br>If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I'd be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though.<br>We're missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you've given us, I would go with S3 as the storage for the files (S3 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you're stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I'd run it on EC2 instead of the AWS Elasticsearch service, as IMHO it's not ready yet. Don't autoscale<br>Elasticsearch automatically though, it'll cause all sorts of issues. I have zero experience with CloudSearch so ic an't comment on that. Regardless of which option, I'd use CloudFormation for all of it.

                Bucket Owner Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own<br>In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own.<br>Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues:<br>The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions.<br>Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported.<br>In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket.<br>Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles<br>IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it:<br>A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role.<br>An access policy defining what permissionsfor example, s3:GetObjectare allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see<br>Specifying Permissions in a Policy<br>.<br>The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects:<br>Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials.<br>Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket.<br>For more information about IAM roles, go to<br>Roles (Delegation and Federation)<br>in IAM User Guide.<br>The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps:<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0001800001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br>Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects.<br>Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A.<br>Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner.<br>Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role.<br>User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket.<br>For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see<br>About Using an Administrator User to Create<br><br>Resources and Grant Permissions -<br>) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0001800002.png" class="in-exam-image">

                How Health Checks Work in Complex Amazon Route 53 Configurations<br>Checking the health of resources in complex configurations works much the same way as in simple configurations. However, in complex configurations, you use a combination of alias resource record sets<br>(including weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias) and nonalias resource record sets to build a decision tree that gives you greater control over how Amazon Route 53 responds to requests. For more information, see<br>How Health Checks Work in Simple Amazon Route 53 Configurations<br>.<br>For example, you might use latency alias resource record sets to select a region close to a user and use weighted resource record sets for two or more resources within each region to protect against the failure of a single endpoint or an Availability Zone. The following diagram shows this configuration.<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002000001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br>Here's how Amazon EC2 and Amazon Route 53 are configured:<br>You have Amazon EC2 instances in two regions, us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2. You want Amazon Route 53 to respond to queries by using the resource record sets in the region that provides the lowest latency for your customers, so you create a latency alias resource record set for each region. (You create the latency alias resource record sets after you create resource record sets for the individual Amazon EC2 instances.)<br>Within each region, you have two Amazon EC2 instances. You create a weighted resource record set for each instance. The name and the type are the same for both of the weighted resource record sets in each region.<br>When you have multiple resources in a region, you can create weighted or failover resource record sets for your resources. You can also create even more complex configurations by creating weighted alias or failover alias resource record sets that, in turn, refer to multiple resources.<br>Each weighted resource record set has an associated health check. The IP address for each health check matches the IP address for the corresponding resource record set. This isn't required, but it's the most common configuration.<br>For both latency alias resource record sets, you set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes.<br>You use the Evaluate Target Health setting for each latency alias resource record set to make Amazon<br>Route 53 evaluate the health of the alias targetsthe weighted resource record setsand respond accordingly.<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002100001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br>The preceding diagram illustrates the following sequence of events:<br>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request,<br>Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br>Amazon Route 53 selects a weighted resource record set based on weight. Evaluate Target Health is Yes for the latency alias resource record set, so Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the selected weighted resource record set.<br>The health check failed, so Amazon Route 53 chooses another weighted resource record set based on weight and checks its health. That resource record set also is unhealthy.<br>Amazon Route 53 backs out of that branch of the tree, looks for the latency alias resource record set with the next-best latency, and chooses the resource record set for ap-southeast-2.<br>Amazon Route 53 again selects a resource record set based on weight, and then checks the health of the selected resource record set. The health check passed, so Amazon Route 53 returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br>What Happens When You Associate a Health Check with an Alias Resource Record Set?<br>You can associate a health check with an alias resource record set instead of or in addition to setting the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. However, it's generally more useful if Amazon Route 53 responds to queries based on the health of the underlying resourcesthe HTTP servers, database servers, and other resources that your alias resource record sets refer to. For example, suppose the following configuration:<br>You assign a health check to a latency alias resource record set for which the alias target is a group of weighted resource record sets.<br>You set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes for the latency alias resource record set.<br>In this configuration, both of the following must be true before Amazon Route 53 will return the applicable value for a weighted resource record set:<br>The health check associated with the latency alias resource record set must pass.<br>At least one weighted resource record set must be considered healthy, either because it's associated with a health check that passes or because it's not associated with a health check. In the latter case, Amazon<br>Route 53 always considers the weighted resource record set healthy.<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002200001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br>If the health check for the latency alias resource record set fails, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using any of the weighted resource record sets in the alias target, even if they're all healthy. Amazon<br>Route 53 doesn't know the status of the weighted resource record sets because it never looks past the failed health check on the alias resource record set.<br>What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?<br>In a complex configuration, it's important to associate health checks with all of the non-alias resource record sets. Let's return to the preceding example, but assume that a health check is missing on one of the weighted resource record sets in the us-east-1 region:<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002300001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br>Here's what happens when you omit a health check on a non-alias resource record set in this configuration:<br>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request,<br>Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br>Amazon Route 53 looks up the alias target for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the status of the corresponding health checks. The health check for one weighted resource record set failed, so that resource record set is omitted from consideration.<br>The other weighted resource record set in the alias target for the us-east-1 region has no health check. The corresponding resource might or might not be healthy, but without a health check, Amazon Route 53 has no way to know. Amazon Route 53 assumes that the resource is healthy and returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br>What Happens When You Set Evaluate Target Health to No?<br>In general, you also want to set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for all of the alias resource record sets. In the following example, all of the weighted resource record sets have associated health checks, but Evaluate<br>Target Health is set to No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region:<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002400001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br>Here's what happens when you set Evaluate Target Health to No for an alias resource record set in this configuration:<br>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request,<br>Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br>Amazon Route 53 determines what the alias target is for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the corresponding health checks. They're both failing.<br>Because the value of Evaluate Target Health is No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region, Amazon Route 53 must choose one resource record set in this branch instead of backing out of the branch and looking for a healthy resource record set in the ap-southeast-2 region.

Unfortunately, this app requires access to a number of on-premises services and no one who configured the app still works for your company. Even worse there's no documentation for it.<br>What will allow the application running inside the VPC to reach back and access its internal dependencies without being reconfigured?

                AWS Direct Connect -<br>AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.<br>Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or collocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.<br>AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the<br>AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as<br>Amazon EC2 instances running within an<br>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)<br>using private IP space, while<br>maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs.<br>What is AWS Direct Connect?<br>AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS<br>Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud<br>(for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service<br>(Amazon S3) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and<br>AWS GovCloud (US).<br>The following diagram shows how AWS Direct Connect interfaces with your network.<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002700001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br><br>Requirements -<br>To use AWS Direct Connect, your network must meet one of the following conditions:<br>Your network is collocated with an existing AWS Direct Connect location. For more information on available<br>AWS Direct Connect locations, go to<br>http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/<br>.<br>You are working with an AWS Direct Connect partner who is a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN).<br>For a list of AWS Direct Connect partners who can help you connect, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ directconnect<br>.<br>You are working with an independent service provider to connect to AWS Direct Connect.<br>In addition, your network must meet the following conditions:<br>Connections to AWS Direct Connect require single mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX (1310nm) for 1 gigabit Ethernet, or 10GBASE-LR (1310nm) for 10 gigabit Ethernet. Auto Negotiation for the port must be disabled. You must support 802.1Q VLANs across these connections.<br>Your network must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP MD5 authentication. Optionally, you may configure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).<br>To connect to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you must first do the following:<br>Provide a private Autonomous System Number (ASN). Amazon allocates a private IP address in the 169.x.x.x range to you.<br>Create a virtual private gateway and attach it to your VPC. For more information about creating a virtual private gateway, see<br>Adding a Hardware Virtual Private Gateway to Your VPC<br>in the Amazon VPC User Guide.<br>To connect to public AWS products such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3, you need to provide the following:<br>A public ASN that you own (preferred) or a private ASN.<br>Public IP addresses (/31) (that is, one for each end of the BGP session) for each BGP session. If you do not have public IP addresses to assign to this connection, log on to AWS and then open a ticket with AWS<br><br>Support -<br>.<br>The public routes that you will advertise over BGP.

                Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.<br>Amazon EBS provides three volume types: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic.<br>The three volume types differ in performance characteristics and cost, so you can choose the right storage performance and price for the needs of your applications. All EBS volume types offer the same durable snapshot capabilities and are designed for 99.999% availability.

                Using Reduced Redundancy Storage Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to Amazon S3. You can assign objects a specific storage class<br>(standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon S3 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon S3. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see<br><br>Object Key and Metadata -<br>.<br>In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.<br>Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store<br>10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects).<br>Note:<br>This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year.<br>Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon S3 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.<br>If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon S3 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon S3 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon S3 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket.<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0003200001.png" class="in-exam-image">

                Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments -<br>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance,<br>Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.<br><br>Enhanced Durability -<br><br>Multi-AZ deployments for the -<br><br>MySQL -<br>,<br><br>Oracle -<br>, and<br><br>PostgreSQL -<br>engines utilize synchronous physical<br>replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the<br><br>SQL Server -<br>engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability<br>Zone.<br>If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.<br><br>Amazon Aurora -<br>employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones.<br>Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.<br><br>Increased Availability -<br>You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability<br>Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines<br>(see the<br><br>RDS FAQ -<br>for details).<br>The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.<br>Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby.<br>However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments.<br>On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no<br>Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.

                As per the document defined, new IPs should be reserved not the same ones<br>Elastic IP Addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing.

                Overview of Creating Amazon EBS-Backed AMIs<br>First, launch an instance from an AMI that's similar to the AMI that you'd like to create. You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is configured correctly, ensure data integrity by stopping the instance before you create an AMI, then create the image. When you create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, we automatically register it for you.<br>Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process. If you're confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance.<br>During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance's root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance. If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new<br>AMI only launches successfully on instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see<br><br>Amazon EBS Encryption -<br>.<br>Depending on the size of the volumes, it can take several minutes for the AMI-creation process to complete<br>(sometimes up to 24 hours). You may find it more efficient to create snapshots of your volumes prior to creating your AMI. This way, only small, incremental snapshots need to be created when the AMI is created, and the process completes more quickly (the total time for snapshot creation remains the same). For more information, see<br><br>Creating an Amazon EBS Snapshot -<br>.<br>After the process completes, you have a new AMI and snapshot created from the root volume of the instance.<br>When you launch an instance using the new AMI, we create a new EBS volume for its root volume using the snapshot. Both the AMI and the snapshot incur charges to your account until you delete them. For more information, see<br><br>Deregistering Your AMI -<br>.<br>If you add instance-store volumes or EBS volumes to your instance in addition to the root device volume, the block device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes, and the block device mappings for instances that you launch from the new AMI automatically contain information for these volumes. The instance-store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the new instance are new and don't contain any data from the instance store volumes of the instance you used to create the AMI. The data on EBS volumes persists. For more information, see<br><br>Block Device Mapping -<br>.

                Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own<br>In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own.<br>Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues:<br>The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions.<br>Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported.<br>In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket.<br>Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles<br>IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it:<br>A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role.<br>An access policy defining what permissionsfor example, s3:GetObjectare allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see<br>Specifying Permissions in a Policy<br>.<br>The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects:<br>Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials.<br>Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket.<br>For more information about IAM roles, go to<br>Roles (Delegation and Federation)<br>in IAM User Guide.<br>The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps:<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0003900001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br>Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects.<br>Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A.<br>Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner.<br>Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role.<br>User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket.<br>For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see<br>About Using an Administrator User to Create<br><br>Resources and Grant Permissions -<br>) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0003900002.png" class="in-exam-image">

            An AWS customer runs a public blogging website. The site users upload two million blog entries a month. The average blog entry size is 200 KB. The access rate to blog entries drops to negligible 6 months after publication and users rarely access a blog entry 1 year after publication. Additionally, blog entries have a high update rate during the first 3 months following publication, this drops to no updates after 6 months.

            You are implementing a URL whitelisting system for a company that wants to restrict outbound HTTP'S connections to specific domains from their EC2-hosted applications. You deploy a single EC2 instance running proxy software and configure It to accept traffic from all subnets and EC2 instances in the VPC. You configure the proxy to only pass through traffic to domains that you define in its whitelist configuration. You have a nightly maintenance window or 10 minutes where all instances fetch new software updates. Each update Is about 200MB In size and there are 500 instances In the VPC that routinely fetch updates. After a few days you notice that some machines are failing to successfully download some, but not all of their updates within the maintenance window. The download URLs used for these updates are correctly listed in the proxy's whitelist configuration and you are able to access them manually using a web browser on the instances.<br>What might be happening? (Choose 2)<br>

                            You are running the proxy on an undersized EC2 instance type so network throughput is not sufficient for all instances to download their updates in time.

                            You are running the proxy on a sufficiently-sized EC2 instance in a private subnet and its network throughput is being throttled by a NAT running on an undersized EC2 instance.

                            The route table for the subnets containing the affected EC2 instances is not configured to direct network traffic for the software update locations to the proxy.

                            </span>

                            You have not allocated enough storage to the EC2 instance running the proxy so the network buffer is filling up, causing some requests to fail.

                Web Identity Federation -<br>Imagine that you are creating a mobile app that accesses AWS resources, such as a game that runs on a mobile device and stores player and score information using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.<br>When you write such an app, you'll make requests to AWS services that must be signed with an AWS access key. However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWS credentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app.<br>With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities.<br>Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) such as Login with Amazon,<br><br>Facebook, Google, or any other -<br>OpenID Connect (OIDC)<br>-compatible IdP, receive an authentication token, and<br>then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.<br>For most scenarios, we recommend that you use<br><br>Amazon Cognito -<br>because it acts as an identity broker and<br>does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section,<br><br>Using Amazon Cognito for -<br><br>Mobile Apps -<br>.<br>If you don't use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon,<br>Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible IdP) and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it.<br>Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps<br>The preferred way to use web identity federation is to use<br><br>Amazon Cognito -<br>. For example, Adele the developer<br>is building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in IAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they've already established with a well-known identity provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect<br>(OIDC)-compatible identity provider. Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user's identity.<br>To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer ID with her chosen IdPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWS account that contains the Amazon S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to create<br>IAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC IdP, she also creates an IAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish trust between her AWS account and the IdP.<br>In the app's code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the IdP that she configured previously. The IdP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele's app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. The app can then use these credentials to access web services offered by AWS. The app is limited to the permissions that are defined in the role that it assumes.<br>The following figure shows a simplified flow for how this might work, using Login with Amazon as the IdP. For<br>Step 2, the app can also use Facebook, Google, or any OIDC-compatible identity provider, but that's not shown here.<br>Sample workflow using Amazon Cognito to federate users for a mobile application<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0004300001.jpg" class="in-exam-image"><br>A customer starts your app on a mobile device. The app asks the user to sign in.<br>The app uses Login with Amazon resources to accept the user's credentials.<br>The app uses Cognito APIs to exchange the Login with Amazon ID token for a Cognito token.<br>The app requests temporary security credentials from AWS STS, passing the Cognito token.<br>The temporary security credentials can be used by the app to access any AWS resources required by the app to operate. The role associated with the temporary security credentials and its assigned policies determines what can be accessed.<br>Use the following process to configure your app to use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users and give your app access to AWS resources. For specific steps to accomplish this scenario, consult the documentation for<br>Amazon Cognito.<br>(Optional) Sign up as a developer with Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect<br>(OIDC)compatible identity provider and configure one or more apps with the provider. This step is optional because Amazon Cognito also supports unauthenticated (guest) access for your users.<br><br>Go to -<br>Amazon Cognito in the AWS Management Console<br>. Use the Amazon Cognito wizard to create an<br>identity pool, which is a container that Amazon Cognito uses to keep end user identities organized for your apps. You can share identity pools between apps. When you set up an identity pool, Amazon Cognito creates one or two IAM roles (one for authenticated identities, and one for unauthenticated "guest" identities) that define permissions for Amazon Cognito users.<br><br>Download and integrate the -<br><br>AWS SDK for iOS -<br>or the<br><br>AWS SDK for Android -<br>with your app, and import the files<br>required to use Amazon Cognito.<br>Create an instance of the Amazon Cognito credentials provider, passing the identity pool ID, your AWS account number, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the roles that you associated with the identity pool. The Amazon Cognito wizard in the AWS Management Console provides sample code to help you get started.<br>When your app accesses an AWS resource, pass the credentials provider instance to the client object, which passes temporary security credentials to the client. The permissions for the credentials are based on the role or roles that you defined earlier.

                There are cases where a large number of batch jobs may need processing, and where the jobs may need to be re-prioritized.<br>For example, one such case is one where there are differences between different levels of services for unpaid users versus subscriber users (such as the time until publication) in services enabling, for example, presentation files to be uploaded for publication from a web browser. When the user uploads a presentation file, the conversion processes, for example, for publication are performed as batch processes on the system side, and the file is published after the conversion. Is it then necessary to be able to assign the level of priority to the batch processes for each type of subscriber?<br>Explanation of the Cloud Solution/Pattern<br>A queue is used in controlling batch jobs. The queue need only be provided with priority numbers. Job requests are controlled by the queue, and the job requests in the queue are processed by a batch server. In<br>Cloud computing, a highly reliable queue is provided as a service, which you can use to structure a highly reliable batch system with ease. You may prepare multiple queues depending on priority levels, with job requests put into the queues depending on their priority levels, to apply prioritization to batch processes. The performance (number) of batch servers corresponding to a queue must be in accordance with the priority level thereof.<br><br>Implementation -<br>In AWS, the queue service is the Simple Queue Service (SQS). Multiple SQS queues may be prepared to prepare queues for individual priority levels (with a priority queue and a secondary queue). Moreover, you may also use the message Delayed Send function to delay process execution.<br>Use SQS to prepare multiple queues for the individual priority levels.<br>Place those processes to be executed immediately (job requests) in the high priority queue.<br>Prepare numbers of batch servers, for processing the job requests of the queues, depending on the priority levels.<br>Queues have a message "Delayed Send" function. You can use this to delay the time for starting a process.<br><br>Configuration -<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0004600001.png" class="in-exam-image"><br><br>Benefits -<br>You can increase or decrease the number of servers for processing jobs to change automatically the processing speeds of the priority queues and secondary queues.<br>You can handle performance and service requirements through merely increasing or decreasing the number of<br>EC2 instances used in job processing.<br>Even if an EC2 were to fail, the messages (jobs) would remain in the queue service, enabling processing to be continued immediately upon recovery of the EC2 instance, producing a system that is robust to failure.<br><br>Cautions -<br>Depending on the balance between the number of EC2 instances for performing the processes and the number of messages that are queued, there may be cases where processing in the secondary queue may be completed first, so you need to monitor the processing speeds in the primary queue and the secondary queue.

            A web company is looking to implement an external payment service into their highly available application deployed in a VPC Their application EC2 instances are behind a public facing ELB. Auto scaling is used to add additional instances as traffic increases under normal load the application runs 2 instances in the Auto Scaling group but at peak it can scale 3x in size. The application instances need to communicate with the payment service over the Internet which requires whitelisting of all public IP addresses used to communicate with it. A maximum of 4 whitelisting IP addresses are allowed at a time and can be added through an API.<br>How should they architect their solution?<br>

                Imagine that in your organization, you want to provide a way for users to copy data from their computers to a backup folder. You build an application that users can run on their computers. On the back end, the application reads and writes objects in an S3 bucket. Users dont have direct access to AWS. Instead, the application communicates with an identity provider (IdP) to authenticate the user. The IdP gets the user information from your organizations identity store (such as an LDAP directory) and then generates a SAML assertion that includes authentication and authorization information about that user. The application then uses that assertion to make a call to the AssumeRoleWithSAML API to get temporary security credentials. The app can then use those credentials to access a folder in the S3 bucket thats specific to the user. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/<br>IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html

            Your company hosts a social media website for storing and sharing documents. The web application allows user to upload large files while resuming and pausing the upload as needed. Currently, files are uploaded to your PHP front end backed by Elastic Load Balancing and an autoscaling fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute<br>Cloud (EC2) instances that scale upon average of bytes received (NetworkIn). After a file has been uploaded, it is copied to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Amazon EC2 instances use an AWS Identity and Access<br>Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon S3 uploads. Over the last six months, your user base and scale have increased significantly, forcing you to increase the Auto Scaling groups Max parameter a few times. Your<br>CFO is concerned about rising costs and has asked you to adjust the architecture where needed to better optimize costs.<br>Which architecture change could you introduce to reduce costs and still keep your web application secure and scalable?<br>

            You are migrating a legacy client-server application to AWS. The application responds to a specific DNS domain (e.g. www.example.com) and has a 2-tier architecture, with multiple application servers and a database server. Remote clients use TCP to connect to the application servers. The application servers need to know the IP address of the clients in order to function properly and are currently taking that information from the TCP socket. A Multi-AZ RDS MySQL instance will be used for the database.<br>During the migration you can change the application code, but you have to file a change request.<br>How would you implement the architecture on AWS in order to maximize scalability and high availability?<br>

            You are responsible for a web application that consists of an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer in front of an Auto Scaling group of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. For a recent deployment of a new version of the application, a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) was created, and the Auto Scaling group was updated with a new launch configuration that refers to this new AMI. During the deployment, you received complaints from users that the website was responding with errors. All instances passed the ELB health checks.<br>What should you do in order to avoid errors for future deployments? (Choose 2)<br>

                            Add an Elastic Load Balancing health check to the Auto Scaling group. Set a short period for the health checks to operate as soon as possible in order to prevent premature registration of the instance to the load balancer.

The following table shows the ARN format for each and an example. The region portion of the ARN is blank because IAM resources are global.

            A company is running a batch analysis every hour on their main transactional DB, running on an RDS MySQL instance, to populate their central Data Warehouse running on Redshift. During the execution of the batch, their transactional applications are very slow. When the batch completes they need to update the top management dashboard with the new data. The dashboard is produced by another system running on- premises that is currently started when a manually-sent email notifies that an update is required. The on- premises system cannot be modified because is managed by another team.<br>How would you optimize this scenario to solve performance issues and automate the process as much as possible?<br>

                Amazon RDS allows you to use read replicas with<br><br>Multi-AZ deployments -<br>. In Multi-AZ deployments for MySQL,<br>Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, the data in your primary DB Instance is synchronously replicated to to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Because of their synchronous replication, Multi-AZ deployments for these engines offer greater data durability benefits than do read replicas. (In all Amazon RDS for Aurora deployments, your data is automatically replicated across 3 Availability Zones.)<br>You can use Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas in conjunction to enjoy the complementary benefits of each. You can simply specify that a given Multi-AZ deployment is the source DB Instance for your Read replicas. That way you gain both the data durability and availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments and the read scaling benefits of read replicas.<br>Note that for Multi-AZ deployments, you have the option to create your read replica in an AZ other than that of the primary and the standby for even more redundancy. You can identify the AZ corresponding to your standby by looking at the "Secondary Zone" field of your DB Instance in the AWS Management Console.

You can create a policy statement that requires users to specify an optional parameter, or restricts users to particular values for a parameter. The examples in this section demonstrate some of the many possible ways that you can control the configuration of an instance that a user can launch.<br>Note that by default, users don't have permission to describe, start, stop, or terminate the resulting instances.<br>One way to grant the users permission to manage the resulting instances is to create a specific tag for each instance, and then create a statement that enables them to manage instances with that tag. For more information, see<br>2: Working with instances<br>.<br>a. AMI<br>The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the AMIs that have the specified tag,<br>"department=dev", associated with them. The users can't launch instances using other AMIs because the<br>Condition element of the first statement requires that users specify an AMI that has this tag. The users also can't launch into a subnet, as the policy does not grant permissions for the subnet and network interface resources. They can, however, launch into EC2-Classic. The second statement uses a wildcard to enable users to create instance resources, and requires users to specify the key pair project_keypair and the security group sg-1a2b3c4d. Users are still able to launch instances without a key pair.<br>{<br>"Version": "2012-10-17",<br>"Statement": [{<br>"Effect": "Allow",<br>"Action": "ec2:RunInstances",<br>"Resource": [<br>"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*"<br>],<br>"Condition": {<br>"StringEquals": {<br>"ec2:ResourceTag/department": "dev"<br>}<br>}<br>},<br>{<br>"Effect": "Allow",<br>"Action": "ec2:RunInstances",<br>"Resource": [<br>"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*",<br>"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*",<br>"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/project_keypair",<br>"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/sg-1a2b3c4d"<br>]<br>}<br>]<br>}<br>Alternatively, the following policy allows users to launch instances using only the specified AMIs, ami-9e1670f7 and ami-45cf5c3c.

                Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance,<br>Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.<br><br>Benefits -<br><br>Enhanced Durability -<br><br>Multi-AZ deployments for the -<br><br>MySQL -<br>,<br><br>Oracle -<br>, and<br><br>PostgreSQL -<br>engines utilize synchronous physical<br>replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the<br><br>SQL Server -<br>engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability<br>Zone.<br>If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.<br><br>Amazon Aurora -<br>employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones.<br>Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.<br><br>Increased Availability -<br>You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability<br>Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines<br>(see the<br><br>RDS FAQ -<br>for details).<br>The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.<br>Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby.<br>However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments.<br>On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no<br>Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.<br><br>No Administrative Intervention -<br>DB Instance failover is fully automatic and requires no administrative intervention. Amazon RDS monitors the health of your primary and standbys, and initiates a failover automatically in response to a variety of failure conditions.<br><br>Failover conditions -<br>Amazon RDS detects and automatically recovers from the most common failure scenarios for Multi-AZ deployments so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. Amazon RDS automatically performs a failover in the event of any of the following:<br>✑ Loss of availability in primary Availability Zone<br>✑ Loss of network connectivity to primary<br>✑ Compute unit failure on primary<br>✑ Storage failure on primary<br>Note: When operations such as DB Instance scaling or system upgrades like OS patching are initiated for<br>Multi-AZ deployments, for enhanced availability, they are applied first on the standby prior to an automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is limited only to the time required for automatic failover to complete. Note that Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments do not failover automatically in response to database operations such as long running queries, deadlocks or database corruption errors.

                Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed application components performing different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build a distributed, decoupled application, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other<br>AWS infrastructure web services.<br>What can I do with Amazon SQS?<br>Amazon SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for a computer to process them. This allows you to quickly build message queuing applications that can be run on any computer on the internet. Since Amazon SQS is highly scalable and you only pay for what you use, you can start small and grow your application as you wish, with no compromise on performance or reliability. This lets you focus on building sophisticated message-based applications, without worrying about how the messages are stored and managed. You can use Amazon SQS with software applications in various ways. For example, you can:<br>Integrate Amazon SQS with other AWS infrastructure web services to make applications more reliable and flexible.<br>Use Amazon SQS to create a queue of work where each message is a task that needs to be completed by a process. One or many computers can read tasks from the queue and perform them.<br>Build a microservices architecture, using queues to connect your microservices.<br>Keep notifications of significant events in a business process in an Amazon SQS queue. Each event can have a corresponding message in a queue, and applications that need to be aware of the event can read and process the messages.

                Q: Can a global secondary index key be defined on non-unique attributes?<br>Yes. Unlike the primary key on a table, a GSI index does not require the indexed attributes to be unique.<br>Q: Are GSI key attributes required in all items of a DynamoDB table?<br>No. GSIs are sparse indexes. Unlike the requirement of having a primary key, an item in a DynamoDB table does not have to contain any of the GSI keys. If a GSI key has both hash and range elements, and a table item omits either of them, then that item will not be indexed by the corresponding GSI. In such cases, a GSI can be very useful in efficiently locating items that have an uncommon attribute.<br>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/

                One ELB cannot handle different SSL certificates but since we are using sticky sessions it must be handled at the ELB level. SSL could be handled on the EC2 instances only with TCP configured ELB, ELB supports sticky sessions only in HTTP/HTTPS configurations.<br>The way the Elastic Load Balancer does session stickiness is on a HTTP/HTTPS listener is by utilizing an<br>HTTP cookie. If SSL traffic is not terminated on the Elastic Load Balancer and is terminated on the back-end instance, the Elastic Load Balancer has no visibility into the HTTP headers and therefore can not set or read any of the HTTP headers being passed back and forth. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/ latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-sticky- sessions.html

                            Use a DynamoDB table with an attribute defining the priority level. Transformation instances will scan the table for tasks, sorting the results by priority level.

                            Use two SQS queues, one for high priority messages, the other for default priority. Transformation instances first poll the high priority queue; if there is no message, they poll the default priority queue.

                Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users<br>Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, its usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.), define the relevant permissions for each group, and then assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to. http:// docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#use-groups-for-permissions

            A user is running a batch process on EBS backed EC2 instances. The batch process launches few EC2 instances to process Hadoop Map reduce jobs which can run between 50 ?600 minutes or sometimes for even more time. The user wants a configuration that can terminate the instance only when the process is completed.<br>How can the user configure this with CloudWatch?<br>

                Amazon CloudWatch alarm watches a single metric over a time period that the user specifies and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The user can setup an action which terminates the instances when their CPU utilization is below a certain threshold for a certain period of time. The EC2 action can either terminate or stop the instance as part of the EC2 action. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingAlarmActions.html

                The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. The organization wants to extend their network into the cloud and also directly access the internet from their AWS VPC. Thus, the organization should setup a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a public subnet and a private subnet, and a virtual private gateway to enable communication with their data center network over an IPsec VPN tunnel. To setup this configuration the organization needs to use the<br>Amazon VPC with a VPN connection. The organization network administrator must designate a physical appliance as a customer gateway and configure it. The organization would need the below mentioned information to setup this configuration:<br>The type of customer gateway, such as Cisco ASA, Juniper J-Series, Juniper SSG, Yamaha Internet-routable<br>IP address (static) of the customer gateway's external interface Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous<br>System Number (ASN) of the customer gateway, if the organization is creating a dynamically routed VPN connection.

            An organization is planning to host a Wordpress blog as well a joomla CMS on a single instance launched with<br>VPC. The organization wants to have separate domains for each application and assign them using Route 53.<br>The organization may have about ten instances each with two applications as mentioned above. While launching the instance, the organization configured two separate network interfaces (primary + ENI) and wanted to have two elastic IPs for that instance. It was suggested to use a public IP from AWS instead of an elastic IP as the number of elastic IPs is restricted.<br>What action will you recommend to the organization?<br>

                            I agree with the suggestion but will prefer that the organization should use separate subnets with each ENI for different public IPs.

                            I do not agree as it is required to have only an elastic IP since an instance has more than one ENI and AWS does not assign a public IP to an instance with multiple ENIs.

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the user has defined. An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that the user can attach to an instance in a VPC. The user can attach up to two ENIs with a single instance. However, AWS cannot assign a public IP when there are two ENIs attached to a single instance. It is recommended to assign an elastic IP in this scenario. If the organization wants more than 5 EIPs they can request AWS to increase the number. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html

                AWS provides an on demand, scalable infrastructure. AWS EC2 allows the user to launch On- Demand instances and the organization should create an AMI of the running instance. When the organization is experiencing varying loads and the time of the load is not known but it is higher than the routine traffic it is recommended that the organization launches a few instances beforehand and then setups AutoScaling with policies which scale up and down as per the EC2 metrics, such as Network I/O or CPU utilization. If the organization keeps all 10 additional instances as a part of the AutoScaling policy sometimes during a sudden higher load it may take time to launch instances and may not give an optimal performance. This is the reason it is recommended that the organization keeps an additional 5 instances running and the next 5 instances scheduled as per the AutoScaling policy for cost effectiveness.

            <span class="answer-description">
                The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Dedicated instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a Virtual Private<br>Cloud (VPC) on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. The client's dedicated instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that are not dedicated instances as well as from instances that belong to other AWS accounts. All instances launched with the dedicated tenancy model of VPC will always be dedicated instances. Dedicated tenancy has a limitation that it may not support a few services, such as RDS. Even the EBS will not be on dedicated hardware. However, the user can save some cost as well as reserve some capacity by using a Reserved Instance model with dedicated tenancy. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources, such as RDS into a virtual network that the user has defined. Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that the user can designate to a group of VPC resources based on the security and operational needs.<br>A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (generally private) that a user can create in a VPC and assign to the RDS DB instances. A DB subnet group allows the user to specify a particular VPC when creating the DB instances. Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a given region. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html

                Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Within this virtual private cloud, the user can launch AWS resources, such as an ELB, and EC2 instances. There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal (private) ELB.<br>For the internet facing ELB it is required that the ELB should be in a public subnet. After the user creates the public subnet, he should ensure to associate the route table of the public subnet with the internet gateway to enable the load balancer in the subnet to connect with the internet. The ELB and instances can be in a separate subnet. However, to allow communication between the instance and the ELB the user must configure the security group rules and network ACLs to allow traffic to be routed between the subnets in his VPC. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreateVPCForELB.ht ml

                The two policies that you attach to an IAM role are the access policy and the trust policy. Remember that adding an account to the trust policy of a role is only half of establishing the trust relationship. By default, no users in the trusted accounts can assume the role until the administrator for that account grants the users the permission to assume the role by adding the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to an Allow element for the sts:AssumeRole action. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_modify.html

                In Amazon ElastiCache, a replication group is a collection of Redis Cache Clusters, with one primary read- write cluster and up to five secondary, read-only clusters, which are called read replicas. You can change the roles of the cache clusters within the replication group, with the primary cluster and one of the replicas exchanging roles. You might decide to do this for performance tuning reasons. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/Replication.Redis.Groups.html

                The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Within this virtual private cloud, the user can launch AWS resources, such as an ELB, and EC2 instances.<br>There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal (private) ELB. For internal servers, such as App servers the organization can create an internal load balancer in their VPC and then place back-end application instances behind the internal load balancer. The internal load balancer will route requests to the back-end application instances, which are also using private IP addresses and only accept requests from the internal load balancer.<br>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/vpc-loadbalancer- types.html

                This is true. ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines: 1. Memcached - a widely adopted memory object caching system. ElastiCache is protocol compliant with Memcached, so popular tools that you use today with existing Memcached environments will work seamlessly with the service. 2. Redis - a popular open-source in-memory key-value store that supports data structures such as sorted sets and lists.<br>ElastiCache supports Master / Slave replication and Multi-AZ which can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy.<br>Reference:<br>https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/

                AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.<br>Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.<br>By using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in<br>Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/#details

                AWS provides an on demand, scalable infrastructure. AWS EC2 allows the user to launch On- Demand instances and the organization should create an AMI of the running instance. Copy the AMI to another region to enable Disaster Recovery (DR) in case of region failure. The organization should also use EBS for persistent storage and take a snapshot every 10 minutes to meet Recovery time objective (RTO). They should also setup an elastic IP and use it with Route 53 to route requests to the same IP. When one of the instances fails the organization can launch new instances and assign the same EIP to a new instance to achieve High<br>Availability (HA). The ELB works only for a particular region and does not route requests across regions.<br>Reference:<br>http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Disaster_Recovery.pdf

            An organization is having an application which can start and stop an EC2 instance as per schedule. The organization needs the MAC address of the instance to be registered with its software. The instance is launched in EC2-CLASSIC.<br>How can the organization update the MAC registration every time an instance is booted?<br>
        </p>


            <div class="question-choices-container">

                            </span>

                            The organization should write a boot strapping script which will get the MAC address from the instance metadata and use that script to register with the application.

                            </span>

                            The organization should provide a MAC address as a part of the user data. Thus, whenever the instance is booted the script assigns the fixed MAC address to that instance.

                            </span>

                            The instance MAC address never changes. Thus, it is not required to register the MAC address every time.

                AWS has many solutions for Disaster Recovery(DR) and High Availability(HA). When the organization wants to have HA and DR but are okay to have a longer recovery time they should select the option backup and restore with S3. The data can be sent to S3 using either Direct Connect, Storage Gateway or over the internet.<br>The EC2 instance will pick the data from the S3 bucket when started and setup the environment. This process takes longer but is very cost effective due to the low pricing of S3. In all the other options, the EC2 instance might be running or there will be AMI storage costs. Thus, it will be a costlier option. In this scenario the organization should plan appropriate tools to take a backup, plan the retention policy for data and setup security of the data. http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Disaster_Recovery.pdf

                Temporary credentials in IAM are valid throughout their defined duration of time and hence can't be revoked.<br>However, because permissions are evaluated each time an AWS request is made using the credentials, you can achieve the effect of revoking the credentials by changing the permissions for the credentials even after they have been issued. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_disable-perms.html

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. The VPC is always specific to a region. The user can create a<br>VPC which can span multiple Availability Zones by adding one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. The instance launched will always be in the same availability zone of the respective subnet. When creating an EBS the user cannot specify the subnet or VPC. However, the user must create the EBS in the same zone as the instance so that it can attach the EBS volume to the running instance. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPCSubnet

            An organization is planning to setup a management network on the AWS VPC. The organization is trying to secure the webserver on a single VPC instance such that it allows the internet traffic as well as the back-end management traffic. The organization wants to make so that the back end management network interface can receive the SSH traffic only from a selected IP range, while the internet facing webserver will have an IP address which can receive traffic from all the internet IPs.<br>How can the organization achieve this by running web server on a single instance?<br>
        </p>

                            It is not possible to have two IP addresses for a single instance.

                            The organization should create two network interfaces with the same subnet and security group to assign separate IPs to each network interface.

                            The organization should create two network interfaces with separate subnets so one instance can have two subnets and the respective security groups for controlled access.

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the user has defined. An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that the user can attach to an instance in a VPC. The user can create a management network using two separate network interfaces. For the present scenario it is required that the secondary network interface on the instance handles the public facing traffic and the primary network interface handles the back-end management traffic and it is connected to a separate subnet in the VPC that has more restrictive access controls. The public facing interface, which may or may not be behind a load balancer, has an associated security group to allow access to the server from the internet while the private facing interface has an associated security group allowing SSH access only from an allowed range of IP addresses either within the VPC or from the internet, a private subnet within the VPC or a virtual private gateway.<br>Reference:<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html

An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that the user can attach to an instance in a VPC. An ENI can include attributes such as: a primary private IP address, one or more secondary private IP addresses, one elastic IP address per private IP address, one public IP address, one or more security groups, a MAC address, a source/destination check flag, and a description. The user can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance. The attributes of a network interface follow the network interface as it is attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance. Thus, the user can maintain a fixed MAC using the network interface. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. The VPC also works with IAM and the organization can create<br>IAM users who have access to various VPC services. If an auditor wants to have access to the AWS VPC to verify the rules, the organization should be careful before sharing any data which can allow making updates to the AWS infrastructure. In this scenario it is recommended that the organization creates an IAM user who will have read only access to the VPC.

            An organization is planning to create a secure scalable application with AWS VPC and ELB. The organization has two instances already running and each instance has an ENI attached to it in addition to a primary network interface. The primary network interface and additional ENI both have an elastic IP attached to it.<br>If those instances are registered with ELB and the organization wants ELB to send data to a particular EIP of the instance, how can they achieve this?<br>

                            The organization should ensure that the IP which is required to receive the ELB traffic is attached to a primary network interface.

                Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Within this virtual private cloud, the user can launch AWS resources, such as an ELB, and EC2 instances. There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal (private) ELB.<br>For the internet facing ELB it is required that the ELB should be in a public subnet. When the user registers a multi-homed instance (an instance that has an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) attached) with a load balancer, the load balancer will route the traffic to the IP address of the primary network interface (eth0).<br>Reference:<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/gs-ec2VPC.html

                To define multiple schedules for different activities in the same pipeline, in AWS Data Pipeline, you should define multiple schedule objects in your pipeline definition file and associate the desired schedule to the correct activity via its schedule field. As an example of this, it could allow you to define a pipeline in which log files are stored in Amazon S3 each hour to drive generation of an aggregate report once a day. https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/faqs/

                In AWS OpsWorks, you can control user access to a stack's instances by creating it in a virtual private cloud<br>(VPC). For example, you might not want users to have direct access to your stack's app servers or databases and instead require that all public traffic be channeled through an Elastic Load Balancer. A VPC consists of one or more subnets, each of which contains one or more instances. Each subnet has an associated routing table that directs outbound traffic based on its destination IP address. Instances within a VPC can generally communicate with each other, regardless of their subnet. Subnets whose instances can communicate with the<br>Internet are referred to as public subnets. Subnets whose instances can communicate only with other instances in the VPC and cannot communicate directly with the Internet are referred to as private subnets.<br>AWS OpsWorks requires the VPC to be configured so that every instance in the stack, including instances in private subnets, has access to the following endpoints:<br>The AWS OpsWorks service,<br>https://opsworks-instance-service.us-east-1.amazonaws.com<br>. Amazon S3<br>The package repositories for Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, depending on which operating system you specify.<br>Your app and custom cookbook repositories.<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingstacks-vpc.html#workingstacks-vpc-basics

                Since AWS is a public cloud any application hosted on EC2 is prone to hacker attacks. It becomes extremely important for a user to setup a proper security mechanism on the EC2 instances. A few of the security measures are listed below:<br>Always keep the OS updated with the latest patch<br>Always create separate users with in OS if they need to connect with the EC2 instances, create their keys and disable their password<br>Create a procedure using which the admin can revoke the access of the user when the business work on the<br>EC2 instance is completed. Lock down unnecessary ports.<br>Audit any proprietary applications that the user may be running on the EC2 instance Provide temporary escalated privileges, such as sudo for users who need to perform occasional privileged tasks<br>The IAM is useful when users are required to work with AWS resources and actions, such as launching an instance. It is not useful to connect (RDP / SSH) with an instance. http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1233/

                AWS security follows the shared security model where the user is as much responsible as Amazon. If the user wants to have secure access to AWS while hosting applications on EC2, the first security rule to follow is to enable MFA for all users. This will add an added security layer. In the second step, the user should never give his access or secret access keys to anyone as well as store inside programs. The better solution is to use IAM roles. For critical data of the organization, the user should keep an offsite/ in premise backup which will help to recover critical data in case of security breach. It is recommended to have AWS AMIs and snapshots as well as keep them at other regions so that they will help in the DR scenario. However, in case of a data security breach of the account they may not be very helpful as hacker can delete that.<br>Therefore, creating an AMI and a snapshot of the data at regular intervals as well as keep a copy to separate regions, would not have helped in preventing this action.

                AWS EC2 Spot Instances allow the user to quote his own price for the EC2 computing capacity. The user can simply bid on the spare Amazon EC2 instances and run them whenever his bid exceeds the current Spot<br>Price. The Spot Instance pricing model complements the On-Demand and Reserved Instance pricing models, providing potentially the most cost-effective option for obtaining compute capacity, depending on the application. The only challenge with a Spot Instance is data persistence as the instance can be terminated whenever the spot price exceeds the bid price. In the current scenario a Hadoop job is a temporary job and does not run for a longer period. It fetches data from a persistent DynamoDB. Thus, even if the instance gets terminated there will be no data loss and the job can be re-run. As the output files are large temporary files, it will be useful to store data on ethereal storage for cost savings. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/spot-instances/

                This is true. From the application's point of view, connecting to the cluster configuration endpoint is no different than connecting directly to an individual cache node. In the process of connecting to cache nodes, the application resolves the configuration endpoint's DNS name.

                The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. If the organization wants the Amazon EC2 instances to have a private IP address, he should create a public and private subnet for VPC in each Availability Zone (this is an AWS Elastic<br>Beanstalk requirement). The organization should add their public resources, such as ELB and NAT to the public subnet, and AWC Elastic Beanstalk will assign them unique elastic IP addresses (a static, public IP address). The organization should launch Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet so that AWS Elastic<br>Beanstalk assigns them non-routable private IP addresses. Now the organization should configure route tables with the following rules:<br>✑ route all inbound traffic from ELB to EC2 instances<br>✑ route all outbound traffic from EC2 instances through NAT<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo-vpc.html

                Each EC2 instance performs source/destination checks by default. This means that the instance must be the source or destination of any traffic it sends or receives.

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the user has defined. With VPC the user can specify multiple private IP addresses for his instances.<br>The number of network interfaces and private IP addresses that a user can specify for an instance depends on the instance type. With each network interface the organization can assign an EIP. This scenario helps when the user wants to host multiple websites on a single EC2 instance by using multiple SSL certificates on a single server and associating each certificate with a specific EIP address. It also helps in scenarios for operating network appliances, such as firewalls or load balancers that have multiple private IP addresses for each network interface. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html

                AWS has many solutions for DR (Disaster recovery) and HA (High Availability). When the organization wants to have HA and DR with multi-site solution, it should setup two sites: one on premise and the other on AWS with full capacity. The organization should setup a weighted DNS service which can route traffic to both sites based on the weightage. When one of the sites fails it can route the entire load to another site. The organization would have minimal RTO in this scenario. If the organization setups a single DB instance, it will not work well in failover.<br>Instead they should have two separate DBs in each site and setup data replication based on RTO (recovery time objective) of the organization. http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Disaster_Recovery.pdf

                Amazon EC2 uses an instance profile as a container for an IAM role. When you create an IAM role using the console, the console creates an instance profile automatically and gives it the same name as the role it corresponds to. If you use the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK to create a role, you create the role and instance profile as separate actions, and you might give them different names. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html

                A task runner is an application that polls AWS Data Pipeline for tasks and then performs those tasks. You can either use Task Runner as provided by AWS Data Pipeline, or create a custom Task Runner application.<br>Task Runner is a default implementation of a task runner that is provided by AWS Data Pipeline. When Task<br>Runner is installed and configured, it polls AWS Data Pipeline for tasks associated with pipelines that you have activated. When a task is assigned to Task Runner, it performs that task and reports its status back to AWS<br>Data Pipeline.

                A service account is a special Google account that can be used by applications to access Google services programmatically. This account belongs to your application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved.<br>A service account can have zero or more pairs of service account keys, which are used to authenticate to<br>Google. A service account key is a public/private key pair generated by Google. Google retains the public key, while the user is given the private key. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources, such as RDS into a virtual network that the user has defined. Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that the user can designate to a group of VPC resources based on security and operational needs. A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (generally private) that the user can create in a VPC and assign to the RDS DB instances. A DB subnet group allows the user to specify a particular VPC when creating the DB instances.<br>Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a given region. If the RDS instance is required to be accessible from the internet the organization must enable the VPC attributes, DNS hostnames and DNS resolution. For each RDS DB instance that the user runs in a VPC, he should reserve at least one address in each subnet in the DB subnet group for use by Amazon RDS for recovery actions. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html

                If you create a VPN connection, you must specify the type of routing that you plan to use, which will depend upon on the make and model of your VPN devices. If your VPN device supports Border Gateway Protocol<br>(BGP), you need to specify dynamic routing when you configure your VPN connection. If your device does not support BGP, you should specify static routing. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_VPN.html

                EC2 allows the user to launch On-Demand instances. If the organization is using an application temporarily only for demo purposes the best way to assign an elastic IP would be:<br>Launch an instance with a VPC and assign an EIP to the primary network interface. This way on every instance start it will have the same IP<br>Create a bootstrapping script and provide it some metadata, such as user data which can be used to assign an<br><br>EIP -<br>Create a controller instance which can schedule the start and stop of the instance and provide an EIP as a parameter so that the controller instance can check the instance boot and assign an EIP The instance metadata gives the current instance data, such as the public/private IP.

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. The user can create a subnet with the same size of<br>VPC. However, he cannot create any other subnet since the CIDR of the second subnet will conflict with the first subnet. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html

                Amazon Elasticache clusters can be run in an Amazon VPC. With Amazon VPC, you can define a virtual network topology and customize the network configuration to closely resemble a traditional network that you might operate in your own datacenter. You can now take advantage   of the manageability, availability and scalability benefits of Amazon ElastiCache Clusters in your own isolated network. The same functionality of<br>Amazon ElastiCache, including automatic failure detection, recovery, scaling, auto discovery, Amazon<br>CloudWatch metrics, and software patching, are now available in Amazon VPC. http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/12/20/amazon-elasticache-announces- support-for- amazon-vpc/

            AWS has launched T2 instances which come with CPU usage credit. An organization has a requirement which keeps an instance running for 24 hours. However, the organization has high usage only during 11 AM to 12<br>PM. The organization is planning to use a T2 small instance for this purpose.<br>If the organization already has multiple instances running since Jan 2012, which of the below mentioned options should the organization implement while launching a T2 instance?<br>

                            The organization must migrate to the EC2-VPC platform first before launching a T2 instance.

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. The AWS account provides two platforms:<br>EC2-CLASSIC and EC2-VPC, depending on when the user has created his AWS account and which regions he is using. If the user has created the AWS account after 2013-12-04, it supports only EC2-VPC. In this scenario, since the account is before the required date the supported platform will be EC2-CLASSIC. It is required that the organization creates a VPC as the T2 instances can be launched only as a part of VPC. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-migrate.html

                With Amazon EBS, you can use any of the standard RAID configurations that you can use with a traditional bare metal server, as long as that particular RAID configuration is supported by the operating system for your instance. This is because all RAID is accomplished at the software level. For greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volume, RAID 0 can stripe multiple volumes together; for on-instance redundancy,<br>RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together. RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/raid-config.html

                Task runners call PollForTask to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. If tasks are ready in the work queue, PollForTask returns a response immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, PollForTask uses long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to 90 seconds, during which time any newly scheduled tasks are handed to the task agent. Your remote worker should not call PollForTask again on the same worker group until it receives a response, and this may take up to 90 seconds. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/APIReference/API_PollForTask.html

                The queue length is the number of pending I/O requests for a device. The optimal average queue length will vary for every customer workload, and this value depends on a particular application's sensitivity to IOPS and latency. If the workload is not delivering enough I/O requests to maintain the optimal average queue length, then the EBS volume might not consistently deliver the IOPS that have been provisioned. However, if the workload maintains an average queue length that is higher than the optimal value, then the per-request I/O latency will increase; in this case, the user should provision more IOPS for his volume. AWS recommends that the user should target an optimal average queue length of 1 for every 200 provisioned IOPS and tune that value based on his application requirements. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-workload-demand.html

                The organization can always launch multiple EC2 instances in the same region across multiple AZs for HA and<br>DR. The AWS architecture practice recommends compartmentalizing the functionality such that they can both run in parallel without affecting the performance of the main application. In this scenario logging takes a longer time due to the large size of the log file. Thus, it is recommended that the organization should separate them out and make separate modules and make asynchronous calls among them. This way the application can scale as per the requirement and the performance will not bear the impact of logging. http://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2014/03/aws-and-compartmentalization.html

                When a request is made, the AWS IAM policy decides whether a given request should be allowed or denied.<br>The evaluation logic follows these rules:<br>By default, all requests are denied. (In general, requests made using the account credentials for resources in the account are always allowed.)<br>An explicit allow policy overrides this default. An explicit deny policy overrides any allows.<br>In this case since there are explicit deny and explicit allow statements.

                A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IP addresses. EC2 instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account within a single region. AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a VPC peering connection; it is neither a gateway nor a VPN connection, and does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-peering.html

                The basic building block of Amazon RDS is the DB instance. DB instance storage comes in three types:<br>Magnetic, General Purpose (SSD), and Provisioned IOPS (SSD). When you buy a server, you get CPU, memory, storage, and IOPS, all bundled together. With Amazon RDS, these are split apart so that you can scale them independently. So, for example, if you need more CPU, less IOPS, or more storage, you can easily allocate them. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/RDSFAQ.PIOPS.html

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the user has defined. AWS provides two features that the user can use to increase security in VPC: security groups and network ACLs. When the user wants to setup both the DB and App on VPC, the user should make one public and one private subnet. The DB should be hosted in a private subnet and instances in that subnet cannot reach the internet. The user can allow an instance in his VPC to initiate outbound connections to the internet but prevent unsolicited inbound connections from the internet by using a Network Address Translation (NAT) instance. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html

If an organization is planning to host their application on AWS EC2, they should perform the below mentioned security checks as a measure to find any security weakness/data leaks:<br>Perform penetration testing as performed by attackers to find any vulnerability. The organization must take an approval from AWS before performing penetration testing Perform hardening testing to find if there are any unnecessary ports open Perform SQL injection to find any DB security issues<br>The code memory checks are generally useful when the organization wants to improve the application performance. http://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/

                A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has created a public private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from the Internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are created with Wizard, AWS will create two route tables and attach to the subnets. The main route table will have the entry "Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: i- a12345", which allows all the instances in the private subnet to connect to the internet using NAT. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario2.html

                A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. When you launch an instance, you associate one or more security groups with the instance. You add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. If you're using EC2-Classic, you must use security groups created specifically for EC2-Classic. In EC2-Classic, you can associate an instance with up to 500 security groups and add up to 100 rules to a security group. If you're using EC2-VPC, you must use security groups created specifically for your VPC.

                AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS<br>Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud<br>(for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service<br>(Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources, such as RDS into a virtual network that the user has defined. Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that the user can designate to a group of VPC resources based on security and operational needs. A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (generally private) that the user can create in a VPC and which the user assigns to the RDS DB instances. A DB subnet group allows the user to specify a particular VPC when creating DB instances. If the RDS instance is required to be accessible from the internet:<br>The organization must setup that the RDS instance is enabled with the VPC attributes, DNS hostnames and<br>DNS resolution.<br>The organization must enable the parameter in the console which makes the RDS instance publicly accessible.<br>The organization must allow access from the internet in the RDS VPC security group. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html

                Yes, you can configure more than one load balancer with an autoscaling group. Auto Scaling integrates with<br>Elastic Load Balancing to enable you to attach one or more load balancers to an existing Auto Scaling group.<br>After you attach the load balancer, it automatically registers the instances in the group and distributes incoming traffic across the instances. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AS_Concepts.html

                The cool down period is the time difference between the end of one scaling activity (can be start or terminate) and the start of another one (can be start or terminate). During the cool down period, Auto Scaling does not allow the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group to be changed by any other CloudWatch alarm. Thus, in this case the trigger from the second alarm will have no effect. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AS_Concepts.html#healthcheck

                Auto Scaling can determine the health status of an instance using custom health checks. If you have custom health checks, you can send the information from your health checks to Auto Scaling so that Auto Scaling can use this information. For example, if you determine that an instance is not functioning as expected, you can set the health status of the instance to Unhealthy. The next time that Auto Scaling performs a health check on the instance, it will determine that the instance is unhealthy and then launch a replacement instance. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/healthcheck.html

                If an Auto Scaling group is launching more than one instance, the cool down period for each instance starts after that instance is launched. The group remains locked until the last instance that was launched has completed its cool down period. In this case the cool down period for the first instance starts after 3 minutes and finishes at the 10th minute (3+7 cool down), while for the second instance it starts at the 4th minute and finishes at the 11th minute (4+7 cool down). Thus, the Auto Scaling group will receive another request only after 11 minutes. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AS_Concepts.html

            <span class="answer-description">
                If you have attached a load balancer to your Auto Scaling group, you can have Auto Scaling include the results of Elastic Load Balancing health checks when it determines the health status of an instance. After you add<br>ELB health checks, Auto Scaling will mark an instance as unhealthy if Elastic Load Balancing reports the instance state as Out of Service. Frequently, an Auto Scaling instance that has just come into service needs to warm up before it can pass the Auto Scaling health check. Auto Scaling waits until the health check grace period ends before checking the health status of the instance. While the EC2 status checks and ELB health checks can complete before the health check grace period expires, Auto Scaling does not act on them until the health check grace period expires. To provide ample warm-up time for your instances, ensure that the health check grace period covers the expected startup time for your application. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/healthcheck.html

By default, these health checks use the results of EC2 instance status checks to determine the health of an instance. If you use a load balancer with your Auto Scaling group, you can optionally choose to include the results of Elastic Load Balancing health checks.<br>Auto Scaling marks an instance unhealthy if the calls to the Amazon EC2 action DescribeInstanceStatus returns any other state other than running, the system status shows impaired, or the calls to Elastic Load<br>Balancing action DescribeInstanceHealth returns OutOfService in the instance state field.<br>After an instance is marked unhealthy because of an Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing health check, it is scheduled for replacement.<br>You can customize the health check conducted by your Auto Scaling group by specifying additional checks or by having your own health check system and then sending the instance's health information directly from your system to Auto Scaling. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/healthcheck.html

                When you use Auto Scaling, your applications gain better fault tolerance. Auto Scaling can detect when an instance is unhealthy, terminate it, and launch an instance to replace it. You can also configure Auto Scaling to use multiple Availability Zones. If one Availability Zone becomes unavailable, Auto Scaling can launch instances in another one to compensate. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/how-as-works.html

                The user may want to stop the automated scaling processes on the Auto Scaling groups either to perform manual operations or during emergency situations. To perform this, the user can suspend one or more scaling processes at any time. When this process is suspended, Auto Scaling creates no new scaling activities for that group. Scaling activities that were already in progress before the group was suspended continue until completed. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AS_Concepts.html

                Since AWS is a public cloud any application hosted on EC2 is prone to hacker attacks. It becomes extremely important for a user to setup a proper security mechanism on the EC2 instances. A few of the security measures are listed below:<br>✑ Always keep the OS updated with the latest patch<br>✑ Always create separate users with in OS if they need to connect with the EC2 instances, create their keys and disable their password<br>✑ Create a procedure using which the admin can revoke the access of the user when the business work on the EC2 instance is completed. . Lock down unnecessary ports<br>✑ Audit any proprietary applications that the user may be running on the EC2 instance. Provide temporary escalated privileges, such as sudo for users who need to perform occasional privileged tasks<br>IAM is useful when users are required to work with AWS resources and actions, such as launching an instance. It is not useful in this case because it does not manage who can connect via RDP or SSH with an instance. http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1233/

                A user can attach more than one security group to a single EC2 instance. In this case, the rules from each security group are effectively aggregated to create one set of rules. AWS uses this set of rules to determine whether to allow access or not. Thus, here the rule for port 22 with IP 10.10.10.1/32 will merge with IP<br>0.0.0.0/0 and open ports 22 and 80 for all.<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html

                It is best to use the latency routing policy when you have resources in multiple Amazon EC2 data centers that perform the same function and you want Amazon Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with the resources that provide the best latency. You could also use the failover routing policy (for public hosted zones only) when you want to configure an active-passive failover, in which one resource takes all traffic when it's available and the other resource takes all traffic when the first resource isn't available. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-latency

                In Amazon Web Services, to help manage EC2 instances as well their usage in a better way, the user can tag the instances. The tags are metadata assigned by the user which consists of a key and value.

                A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. In other words, you can create, update, or delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, or deleting stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template. A stack, for instance, can include all the resources required to run a web application, such as a web server, a database, and networking rules. If you no longer require that web application, you can simply delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted. You are charged for the stack resources for the time they were operating (even if you deleted the stack right away). http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html

                When a stack is in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, you can continue rolling it back to return it to a working state (to UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE). You cannot update a stack that is in the<br>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state. However, if you can continue to roll it back, you can return the stack to its original settings and try to update it again. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks- continueupdaterollback.html

                When you use AWS CloudFormation, you might encounter issues when you create, update, or delete AWS<br>CloudFormation stacks.<br>For Amazon EC2 issues, view the cloud-init and cfn logs. These logs are published on the Amazon EC2 instance in the /var/log/ directory. These logs capture processes and command outputs while AWS<br>CloudFormation is setting up your instance. For Windows, view the EC2Configure service and cfn logs in %<br>ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.<br>You can also configure your AWS CloudFormation template so that the logs are published to Amazon<br>CloudWatch, which displays logs in the AWS Management Console so you don't have to connect to your<br>Amazon EC2 instance.<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html

                To resolve a dependency error, add a Depends On attribute to resources that depend on other resources in your template. In some cases, you must explicitly declare dependencies so that AWS CloudFormation can create or delete resources in the correct order. For example, if you create an Elastic IP and a VPC with an<br>Internet gateway in the same stack, the Elastic IP must depend on the Internet gateway attachment. For additional information, see Depends On Attribute. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting- errors-dependency-error

                These services are designed to complement each other. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment to easily deploy and run applications in the cloud. It is integrated with developer tools and provides a one-stop experience for you to manage the lifecycle of your applications. AWS CloudFormation is a convenient provisioning mechanism for a broad range of AWS resources. It supports the infrastructure needs of many different types of applications such as existing enterprise applications, legacy applications, applications built using a variety of AWS resources and container-based solutions (including those built using AWS Elastic<br>Beanstalk). AWS CloudFormation supports Elastic Beanstalk application environments as one of the AWS resource types. This allows you, for example, to create and manage an AWS Elastic Beanstalk- hosted application along with an RDS database to store the application data. In addition to RDS instances, any other supported AWS resource can be added to the group as well. https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/faqs

                An elastic network interface (ENI) is defined as a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a VPC and can include one public IP address, which can be auto-assigned to the elastic network interface for eth0 when you launch an instance, but only when you create an elastic network interface for eth0 instead of using an existing network interface. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html

            <span class="answer-description">
                You must create a virtual interface to begin using your AWS Direct Connect connection. You can create a public virtual interface to connect to public resources or a private virtual interface to connect to your VPC. Also, it is possible to configure multiple virtual interfaces on a single AWS Direct Connect connection, and you'll need one private virtual interface for each VPC to connect to. Each virtual interface needs a VLAN ID, interface<br>IP address, ASN, and BGP key. To use your AWS Direct Connect connection with another AWS account, you can create a hosted virtual interface for that account. These hosted virtual interfaces work the same as standard virtual interfaces and can connect to public resources or a VPC. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithVirtualInterfaces.html

                You can place an elastic network interface on each of your web servers that connects to a mid- tier network where an application server resides. The application server can also be dual-homed to a back-end network<br>(subnet) where the database server resides.

                The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect VPC from his own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware VPN access to connect with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with Wizard, it will create a virtual private gateway to route all traffic of the VPN subnet. If the user has setup a NAT instance to route all the internet requests, then all requests to the internet should be routed to it. All requests to the organization's DC will be routed to the VPN gateway. Here are the valid entries for the main route table in this scenario:<br>Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 &amp; Target: i-123456 (To route all internet traffic to the NAT Instance) Destination:<br>172.28.0.0/12 &amp; Target: vgw-123456 (To route all the organization's data centre traffic to the VPN gateway)<br>Destination: 20.0.0.0/16 &amp; Target: local (To allow local routing in VPC) http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario3.html

                You can delete your VPC at any time (for example, if you decide it's too small). However, you must terminate all instances in the VPC first. When you delete a VPC using the VPC console, Amazon deletes all its components, such as subnets, security groups, network ACLs, route tables, Internet gateways, VPC peering connections, and DHCP options. If you have a VPN connection, you don't have to delete it or the other components related to the VPN (such as the customer gateway and virtual private gateway). http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Deleting

If the user has not selected the option to attach the public IP, then it will only have a private IP when launched. The user cannot connect to the instance from the internet.

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. When an instance is launched it will have a network interface attached with it. The user cannot delete the subnet until he terminates the instance and deletes the network interface. By default, network interfaces that are automatically created and attached to instances using the console are set to terminate when the instance terminates. However, network interfaces created using the command line interface aren't set to terminate when the instance terminates. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html

            An organization is planning to host a Wordpress blog as well as joomla CMS on a single instance launched with VPC. The organization wants to create separate domains for each application using Route 53. The organization may have about ten instances each with these two applications. While launching each instance, the organization configured two separate network interfaces (primary + secondary ENI) with their own Elastic<br>IPs to the instance. The suggestion was to use a public IP from AWS instead of an Elastic IP as the number of elastic IPs allocation per region is restricted in the account.<br>What action will you recommend to the organization?<br>

            <div class="question-choices-container">

                            </span>

                            Only Elastic IP can be used by requesting limit increase, since AWS does not assign a public IP to an instance with multiple ENIs.

                            </span>

                            AWS VPC does not attach a public IP to an ENI; so the only way is to use an Elastic IP.

                            I agree with the suggestion but will prefer that the organization should use separate subnets with each ENI for different public IPs.

                A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has created a public subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from the internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are created with Wizard, AWS will create a NAT instance of a smaller or higher size, respectively. The VPC has an implied router and the VPC wizard updates the main route table used with the private subnet, creates a custom route table and associates it with the public subnet. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario2.html

                The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Within this virtual private cloud, the user can launch AWS resources, such as elastic load balancers, and EC2 instances. There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal<br>(private) ELB. For internal servers, such as App servers the organization can create an internal load balancer in their VPC and then place back-end application instances behind the internal load balancer. The internal load balancer will route requests to the back-end application instances, which are also using private IP addresses and only accept requests from the internal load balancer. The Internal ELB supports only one subnet in each<br>AZ and asks the user to select a subnet while configuring internal ELB. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/USVPC_creating_basic_lb.html

                The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows the user to define a virtual networking environment in a private, isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. If the organization is planning to implement a scalable secure application using<br>RDS, VPC and ELB the organization should follow below mentioned configurations:<br>Setup RDS in a private subnet Setup ELB in a public subnet<br>Since RDS needs a subnet group, the organization should have two private subnets in the same zone<br>The ELB needs private and public subnet to be part of same AZs It is not required that instances should have a public IP assigned to them. The instances can be a part of a private subnet and the organization can setup a corresponding routing mechanism. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/vpc-rds.html

                With AWS EC2, when a user is launching an instance he can select the availability zone (AZ) at the time of launch. If the zone is not selected, AWS selects it on behalf of the user. Once the instance is launched, the user cannot change the zone of that instance unless he creates an AMI of that instance and launches a new instance from it. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html

                Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency. An io1 volume can range in size from 4 GiB to 16 TiB and you can provision 100 up to 20,000 IOPS per volume. The maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volume size (in GiB) is<br>50:1. For example, a 100 GiB volume can be provisioned with up to 5,000 IOPS. Any volume 400 GiB in size or greater allows provisioning up to the 20,000 IOPS maximum. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html

                When you set up custom NFS client settings, it takes up to three seconds for an Amazon EC2 instance to see a write operation being performed on a file system from another Amazon EC2 instance. To solve this issue, you must unmount and remount your file system with the noac option to disable attribute caching if the NFS client on the Amazon EC2 instance that is reading the data has attribute caching activated. Attribute cache can also be cleared on demand by using a programming language that is compatible with the NFS procedures. To do this, you must send an ACCESS procedure request immediately before a read request. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/troubleshooting.html#custom-nfs-settings-write-delays

                The EBS snapshots are a point in time backup of the EBS volume. It is an incremental snapshot, but is always specific to the region and never specific to a single AZ.

                For Amazon Web Services, the reserved instance (standard or convertible) helps the user save money if the user is going to run the same instance for a longer period. Generally, if the user uses the instances around 30-<br>40% of the year annually it is recommended to use RI. Here as the instance runs only for 1 hour 50 minutes daily, or less than 8 percent of the year, it is not recommended to have RI as it will be costlier. At its highest potential savings, you are still paying 25 percent of an annual cost for a reserved instance you are you using less than 2 hours a day, (or less than 8 percent of each year) you are not saving money. Even a scheduled reserved instance has a key limitation, which is that it cannot be stopped or rebooted, only manually terminated with a possibility that it could be restarted. You would have to terminate and restart it within the 1 hour 50-minute window, otherwise you would need to wait until the next day. For a critical daily process, this is likely not an option. Spot Instances are not ideal because the process is critical, and must run for a fixed length of time at a fixed time of day. Spot instances would stop and start based on fluctuations in instance pricing, leaving this process potentially unfinished. The user should use on-demand with EBS in this case. While it has the highest cost, it also has the greatest flexibility to ensure that a critical process like this is always completed. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/

                CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. To enable detailed instance monitoring for a new Auto Scaling group, the user does not need to take any extra steps. When the user creates the Auto<br>Scaling launch config as the first step for creating an Auto Scaling group, each launch configuration contains a flag named InstanceMonitoring.Enabled. The default value of this flag is true. When the user has created a launch configuration with InstanceMonitoring.Enabled = false it will involve multiple steps to enable detail monitoring. The steps are:<br>✑ Create a new Launch config with detailed monitoring enabled<br>✑ Update the Auto Scaling group with a new launch config<br>✑ Enable detail monitoring on each EC2 instance<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/as-metricscollected.html

                CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. To enable detailed instance monitoring for a new Auto Scaling group, the user does not need to take any extra steps. When the user creates the Auto Scaling launch config as the first step for creating an Auto Scaling group, each launch configuration contains a flag named InstanceMonitoring.Enabled. The default value of this flag is true. When the user has created a launch configuration with<br>InstanceMonitoring.Enabled = false it will involve multiple steps to enable detail monitoring. The steps are:<br>✑ Create a new Launch config with detailed monitoring enabled<br>✑ Update the Auto Scaling group with a new launch config<br>✑ Enable detail monitoring on each EC2 instance<br>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/as-metricscollected.html

            A company runs a legacy system on a single m4.2xlarge Amazon EC2 instance with Amazon EBS2 storage. The EC2 instance runs both the web server and a self-managed Oracle database. A snapshot is made of the EBS volume every 12 hours, and an AMI was created from the fully configured EC2 instance.<br>A recent event that terminated the EC2 instance led to several hours of downtime. The application was successfully launched from the AMI, but the age of the<br>EBS snapshot and the repair of the database resulted in the loss of 8 hours of data. The system was also down for 4 hours while the Systems Operators manually performed these processes.<br>What architectural changes will minimize downtime and reduce the chance of lost data?<br>

            A hybrid network architecture must be used during a company's multi-year data center migration from multiple private data centers to AWS. The current data centers are linked together with private fiber. Due to unique legacy applications, NAT cannot be used. During the migration period, many applications will need access to other applications in both the data centers and AWS.<br>Which option offers a hybrid network architecture that is secure and highly available, that allows for high bandwidth and a multi-region deployment post-migration?<br>

            A company has created an account for individual Development teams, resulting in a total of 200 accounts. All accounts have a single virtual private cloud (VPC) in a single region with multiple microservices running in Docker containers that need to communicate with microservices in other accounts. The Security team requirements state that these microservices must not traverse the public internet, and only certain internal services should be allowed to call other individual services. If there is any denied network traffic for a service, the Security team must be notified of any denied requests, including the source IP.<br>How can connectivity be established between service while meeting the security requirements?<br>

                            Create a VPC peering connection between the VPCs. Use security groups on the instances to allow traffic from the security group IDs that are permitted to call the microservice. Apply network ACLs to and allow traffic from the local VPC and peered VPCs only. Within the task definition in Amazon ECS for each of the microservices, specify a log configuration by using the awslogs driver. Within Amazon CloudWatch Logs, create a metric filter and alarm off of the number of HTTP 403 responses. Create an alarm when the number of messages exceeds a threshold set by the Security team.

Enable VPC Flow Logs, and use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for rejected traffic. Create an IAM role and allow the Security team to call the action for each account. AssumeRole

Adjust network ACLs to allow traffic from the local VPC only. Apply security groups to the microservices to allow traffic from the VPN appliances only. Install the awslogs agent on each VPN appliance, and configure logs to forward to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in the security account for the Security team to access.

Attach the NLB to a PrivateLink endpoint service and whitelist the accounts that will be consuming this service. Create an interface endpoint in the consumer VPC and associate a security group that allows only the security group IDs of the services authorized to call the producer service. On the producer services, create security groups for each microservice and allow only the CIDR range the allowed services. Create VPC Flow Logs on each VPC to capture rejected traffic that will be delivered to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs group.

            An e-commerce company is revamping its IT infrastructure and is planning to use AWS services. The company's CIO has asked a Solutions Architect to design a simple, highly available, and loosely coupled order processing application.

            A company is migrating a subset of its application APIs from Amazon EC2 instances to run on a serverless infrastructure. The company has set up Amazon API<br>Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB for the new application. The primary responsibility of the Lambda function is to obtain data from a third-party<br>Software as a Service (SaaS) provider. For consistency, the Lambda function is attached to the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the original EC2 instances.<br>Test users report an inability to use this newly moved functionality, and the company is receiving 5xx errors from API Gateway. Monitoring reports from the SaaS provider shows that the requests never made it to its systems. The company notices that Amazon CloudWatch Logs are being generated by the Lambda functions. When the same functionality is tested against the EC2 systems, it works as expected.<br>What is causing the issue?<br>

            A company ingests and processes streaming market data. The data rate is constant. A nightly process that calculates aggregate statistics is run, and each execution takes about 4 hours to complete. The statistical analysis is not mission critical to the business, and previous data points are picked up on the next execution if a particular run fails.<br>The current architecture uses a pool of Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances with 1-year reservations running full time to ingest and store the streaming data in attached Amazon EBS volumes. On-Demand EC2 instances are launched each night to perform the nightly processing, accessing the stored data from NFS shares on the ingestion servers, and terminating the nightly processing servers when complete.

            A three-tier web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Cron daemons are used to trigger scripts that collect the web server, application, and database logs and send them to a centralized location every hour.

            A company plans to move regulated and security-sensitive businesses to AWS. The Security team is developing a framework to validate the adoption of AWS best practice and industry-recognized compliance standards. The AWS Management Console is the preferred method for teams to provision resources.<br>Which strategies should a Solutions Architect use to meet the business requirements and continuously assess, audit, and monitor the configurations of AWS resources? (Choose two.)<br>

                            Use AWS Config rules to periodically audit changes to AWS resources and monitor the compliance of the configuration. Develop AWS Config custom rules using AWS Lambda to establish a test-driven development approach, and further automate the evaluation of configuration changes against the required controls.

                            Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs agent to collect all the AWS SDK logs. Search the log data using a pre-defined set of filter patterns that machines mutating API calls. Send notifications using Amazon CloudWatch alarms when unintended changes are performed. Archive log data by using a batch export to Amazon S3 and then Amazon Glacier for a long-term retention and auditability.

                            Use AWS CloudTrail events to assess management activities of all AWS accounts. Ensure that CloudTrail is enabled in all accounts and available AWS services. Enable trails, encrypt CloudTrail event log files with an AWS KMS key, and monitor recorded activities with CloudWatch Logs.

                            </span>

                            Use the Amazon CloudWatch Events near-real-time capabilities to monitor system events patterns, and trigger AWS Lambda functions to automatically revert non-authorized changes in AWS resources. Also, target Amazon SNS topics to enable notifications and improve the response time of incident responses.

                            Use a scheduled AWS Lambda function to scan through the list of running instances within the virtual private cloud (VPC) and determine if any of these are based on unapproved AMIs. Publish a message to an SNS topic to inform Information Security that this occurred and then shut down the instance.

            A company is using an Amazon CloudFront distribution to distribute both static and dynamic content from a web application running behind an Application Load<br>Balancer. The web application requires user authorization and session tracking for dynamic content. The CloudFront distribution has a single cache behavior configured to forward the Authorization, Host, and User-Agent HTTP whitelist headers and a session cookie to the origin. All other cache behavior settings are set to their default value.<br>A valid ACM certificate is applied to the CloudFront distribution with a matching CNAME in the distribution settings. The ACM certificate is also applied to the<br>HTTPS listener for the Application Load Balancer. The CloudFront origin protocol policy is set to HTTPS only. Analysis of the cache statistics report shows that the miss rate for this distribution is very high.<br>What can the Solutions Architect do to improve the cache hit rate for this distribution without causing the SSL/TLS handshake between CloudFront and the<br>Application Load Balancer to fail?<br>

            A company runs a video processing platform. Files are uploaded by users who connect to a web server, which stores them on an Amazon EFS share. This web server is running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. A different group of instances, running in an Auto Scaling group, scans the EFS share directory structure for new files to process and generates new videos (thumbnails, different resolution, compression, etc.) according to the instructions file, which is uploaded along with the video files. A different application running on a group of instances managed by an Auto Scaling group processes the video files and then deletes them from the<br>EFS share. The results are stored in an S3 bucket. Links to the processed video files are emailed to the customer.<br>The company has recently discovered that as they add more instances to the Auto Scaling Group, many files are processed twice, so image processing speed is not improved. The maximum size of these video files is 2GB.<br>What should the Solutions Architect do to improve reliability and reduce the redundant processing of video files?<br>

                            Modify the web application to upload the video files directly to Amazon S3. Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger an AWS Lambda function every time a file is uploaded, and have this Lambda function put a message into an Amazon SQS queue. Modify the video processing application to read from SQS queue for new files and use the queue depth metric to scale instances in the video processing Auto Scaling group.

Using Amazon CloudWatch Events trigger an Amazon SES job to send an email to the customer containing the link to the processed file.

                            Rewrite the web application to run directly from Amazon S3 and use Amazon API Gateway to upload the video files to an S3 bucket. Use an S3 trigger to run an AWS Lambda function each time a file is uploaded to process and store new video files in a different bucket. Using CloudWatch Events, trigger an SES job to send an email to the customer containing the link to the processed file.

                            Set up Amazon API Gateway and create the required API resources and methods. Use an Amazon API Gateway custom authorizer to control access to the API. Configure the methods to use AWS Lambda custom integrations, and process each resource with a unique Lambda function. Store request meta information in an Amazon ElastiCache Multi-AZ cluster and static content in a secured S3 bucket. Generate presigned URLs when returning references to content stored in Amazon S3.

            A large company experienced a drastic increase in its monthly AWS spend. This is after Developers accidentally launched Amazon EC2 instances in unexpected regions. The company has established practices around least privileges for Developers and controls access to on-premises resources using Active Directory groups. The company now want to control costs by restricting the level of access that Developers have to the AWS Management Console without impacting their productivity. The company would also like to allow Developers to launch Amazon EC2 in only one region, without limiting access to other services in any region.<br>How can this company achieve these new security requirements while minimizing the administrative burden on the Operations team?<br>

            A company has a serverless application comprised of Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Lambda functions. The current deployment process of the application code is to create a new version number of the Lambda function and run an AWS CLI script to update. If the new function version has errors, another CLI script reverts by deploying the previous working version of the function. The company would like to decrease the time to deploy new versions of the application logic provided by the Lambda functions, and also reduce the time to detect and revert when errors are identified.<br>How can this be accomplished?<br>

                            Create and deploy nested AWS CloudFormation stacks with the parent stack consisting of the AWS CloudFront distribution and API Gateway, and the child stack containing the Lambda function. For changes to Lambda, create an AWS CloudFormation change set and deploy; if errors are triggered, revert the AWS CloudFormation change set to the previous version.

                            Use AWS SAM and built-in AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the new Lambda version, gradually shift traffic to the new version, and use pre-traffic and post-traffic test functions to verify code. Rollback if Amazon CloudWatch alarms are triggered.

                            Refactor the AWS CLI scripts into a single script that deploys the new Lambda version. When deployment is completed, the script tests execute. If errors are detected, revert to the previous Lambda version.

            A media company has a 30-TB repository of digital news videos. These videos are stored on tape in an on-premises tape library and referenced by a Media Asset<br>Management (MAM) system. The company wants to enrich the metadata for these videos in an automated fashion and put them into a searchable catalog by using a MAM feature. The company must be able to search based on information in the video, such as objects, scenery items, or people's faces. A catalog is available that contains faces of people who have appeared in the videos that include an image of each person. The company would like to migrate these videos to<br>AWS.<br>The company has a high-speed AWS Direct Connect connection with AWS and would like to move the MAM solution video content directly from its current file system.<br>How can these requirements be met by using the LEAST amount of ongoing management overhead and causing MINIMAL disruption to the existing system?<br>

            A company has a standard three-tier architecture using two Availability Zones. During the company's off season, users report that the website is not working. The<br>Solutions Architect finds that no changes have been made to the environment recently, the website is reachable, and it is possible to log in. However, when the<br>Solutions Architect selects the "find a store near you" function, the maps provided on the site by a third-party RESTful API call do not work about 50% of the time after refreshing the page. The outbound API calls are made through Amazon EC2 NAT instances.<br>What is the MOST likely reason for this failure and how can it be mitigated in the future?<br>

                            Build the workflow in AWS Step Functions, using it to orchestrate multiple concurrent workflows. The status of each workflow can be visualized in the AWS Management Console, and historical data can be written to Amazon S3 and visualized using Amazon QuickSight.

            An organization has two Amazon EC2 instances:<br>✑ The first is running an ordering application and an inventory application.<br>✑ The second is running a queuing system.<br>During certain times of the year, several thousand orders are placed per second. Some orders were lost when the queuing system was down. Also, the organization's inventory application has the incorrect quantity of products because some orders were processed twice.<br>What should be done to ensure that the applications can handle the increasing number of orders?<br>

            A Development team is deploying new APIs as serverless applications within a company. The team is currently using the AWS Management Console to provision<br>Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB resources. A Solutions Architect has been tasked with automating the future deployments of these serverless APIs.<br>How can this be accomplished?<br>

                            </span>

                            Use AWS CloudFormation with a Lambda-backed custom resource to provision API Gateway. Use the AWS::DynamoDB::Table and AWS::Lambda::Function resources to create the Amazon DynamoDB table and Lambda functions. Write a script to automate the deployment of the CloudFormation template.
                        </li>

                            Use the AWS Serverless Application Model to define the resources. Upload a YAML template and application files to the code repository. Use AWS CodePipeline to connect to the code repository and to create an action to build using AWS CodeBuild. Use the AWS CloudFormation deployment provider in CodePipeline to deploy the solution.

                            Use AWS CloudFormation to define the serverless application. Implement versioning on the Lambda functions and create aliases to point to the versions. When deploying, configure weights to implement shifting traffic to the newest version, and gradually update the weights as traffic moves over.

                            Commit the application code to the AWS CodeCommit code repository. Use AWS CodePipeline and connect to the CodeCommit code repository. Use AWS CodeBuild to build and deploy the Lambda functions using AWS CodeDeploy. Specify the deployment preference type in CodeDeploy to gradually shift traffic over to the new version.

            A company is moving a business-critical, multi-tier application to AWS. The architecture consists of a desktop client application and server infrastructure. The server infrastructure resides in an on-premises data center that frequently fails to maintain the application uptime SLA of 99.95%. A Solutions Architect must re- architect the application to ensure that it can meet or exceed the SLA.<br>The application contains a PostgreSQL database running on a single virtual machine. The business logic and presentation layers are load balanced between multiple virtual machines. Remote users complain about slow load times while using this latency-sensitive application.<br>Which of the following will meet the availability requirements with little change to the application while improving user experience and minimizing costs?<br>

            A company runs an e-commerce platform with front-end and e-commerce tiers. Both tiers run on LAMP stacks with the front-end instances running behind a load balancing appliance that has a virtual offering on AWS. Currently, the Operations team uses SSH to log in to the instances to maintain patches and address other concerns. The platform has recently been the target of multiple attacks, including<br>✑ A DDoS attack.<br>✑ An SQL injection attack.<br>✑ Several successful dictionary attacks on SSH accounts on the web servers.<br>The company wants to improve the security of the e-commerce platform by migrating to AWS. The company's Solutions Architects have decided to use the following approach:<br>✑ Code review the existing application and fix any SQL injection issues.<br>✑ Migrate the web application to AWS and leverage the latest AWS Linux AMI to address initial security patching.<br>✑ Install AWS Systems Manager to manage patching and allow the system administrators to run commands on all instances, as needed.<br>What additional steps will address all of other identical attack types while providing high availability and minimizing risk?<br>

            A company is migrating its marketing website and content management system from an on-premises data center to AWS. The company wants the AWS application to be developed in a VPC with Amazon EC2 instances used for the web servers and an Amazon RDS instance for the database.<br>The company has a runbook document that describes the installation process of the on-premises system. The company would like to base the AWS system on the processes referenced in the runbook document. The runbook document describes the installation and configuration of the operating systems, network settings, the website, and content management system software on the servers. After the migration is complete, the company wants to be able to make changes quickly to take advantage of other AWS features.<br>How can the application and environment be deployed and automated in AWS, while allowing for future changes?<br>

            A company is adding a new approved external vendor that only supports IPv6 connectivity. The company's backend systems sit in the private subnet of an<br>Amazon VPC. The company uses a NAT gateway to allow these systems to communicate with external vendors over IPv4. Company policy requires systems that communicate with external vendors use a security group that limits access to only approved external vendors. The virtual private cloud (VPC) uses the default network ACL.<br>The Systems Operator successfully assigns IPv6 addresses to each of the backend systems. The Systems Operator also updates the outbound security group to include the IPv6 CIDR of the external vendor (destination). The systems within the VPC are able to ping one another successfully over IPv6. However, these systems are unable to communicate with the external vendor.<br>What changes are required to enable communication with the external vendor?<br>

            A Solutions Architect is designing a network solution for a company that has applications running in a data center in Northern Virginia. The applications in the company's data center require predictable performance to applications running in a virtual private cloud (VPC) located in us-east-1, and a secondary VPC in us- west-2 within the same account. The company data center is collocated in an AWS Direct Connect facility that serves the us-est-1 region. The company has already ordered an AWS Direct Connect connection and a cross-connect has been established.<br>Which solution will meet the requirements at the LOWEST cost?<br>

            A company is moving a business-critical application onto AWS. It is a traditional three-tier web application using an Oracle database. Data must be encrypted in transit and at rest. The database hosts 12 TB of data. Network connectivity to the source Oracle database over the internal is allowed, and the company wants to reduce the operational costs by using AWS Managed Services where possible. All resources within the web and application tiers have been migrated. The database has a few tables and a simple schema using primary keys only; however, it contains many Binary Large Object (BLOB) fields. It was not possible to use the database's native replication tools because of licensing restrictions.<br>Which database migration solution will result in the LEAST amount of impact to the application's availability?<br>
        </p>


            <div class="question-choices-container">

                            Provision an Amazon RDS for Oracle instance. Host the RDS database within a virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet with internet access, and set up the RDS database as an encrypted Read Replica of the source database. Use SSL to encrypt the connection between the two databases. Monitor the replication performance by watching the RDS ReplicaLag metric. During the application maintenance window, shut down the on-premises database and switch over the application connection to the RDS instance when there is no more replication lag. Promote the Read Replica into a standalone database instance.

                            Provision an Amazon EC2 instance and install the same Oracle database software. Create a backup of the source database using the supported tools. During the application maintenance window, restore the backup into the Oracle database running in the EC2 instance. Set up an Amazon RDS for Oracle instance, and create an import job between the database hosted in AWS. Shut down the source database and switch over the database connections to the RDS instance when the job is complete.

                            </span>

                            Use AWS DMS to load and replicate the dataset between the on-premises Oracle database and the replication instance hosted on AWS. Provision an Amazon RDS for Oracle instance with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled and configure it as target for the replication instance. Create a customer-managed AWS KMS master key to set it as the encryption key for the replication instance. Use AWS DMS tasks to load the data into the target RDS instance. During the application maintenance window and after the load tasks reach the ongoing replication phase, switch the database connections to the new database.

                            </span>

                            Create a compressed full database backup on the on-premises Oracle database during an application maintenance window. While the backup is being performed, provision a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection to increase the transfer speed of the database backup files to Amazon S3, and shorten the maintenance window period. Use SSL/TLS to copy the files over the Direct Connect connection. When the backup files are successfully copied, start the maintenance window, and rise any of the Amazon RDS supported tools to import the data into a newly provisioned Amazon RDS for Oracle instance with encryption enabled. Wait until the data is fully loaded and switch over the database connections to the new database. Delete the Direct Connect connection to cut unnecessary charges.

            A company has decided to move some workloads onto AWS to create a grid environment to run market analytics. The grid will consist of many similar instances, spun-up by a job-scheduling function. Each time a large analytics workload is completed, a new VPC is deployed along with job scheduler and grid nodes. Multiple grids could be running in parallel.<br>Key requirements are:<br>✑ Grid instances must communicate with Amazon S3 retrieve data to be processed.<br>✑ Grid instances must communicate with Amazon DynamoDB to track intermediate data,<br>✑ The job scheduler need only to communicate with the Amazon EC2 API to start new grid nodes.<br>A key requirement is that the environment has no access to the internet, either directly or via the on-premises proxy. However, the application needs to be able to seamlessly communicate to Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EC2 API, without the need for reconfiguration for each new deployment.<br>Which of the following should the Solutions Architect do to achieve this target architecture?

            An internal security audit of AWS resources within a company found that a number of Amazon EC2 instances running Microsoft Windows workloads were missing several important operating system-level patches. A Solutions Architect has been asked to fix existing patch deficiencies, and to develop a workflow to ensure that future patching requirements are identified and taken care of quickly. The Solutions Architect has decided to use AWS Systems Manager. It is important that EC2 instance reboots do not occur at the same time on all Windows workloads to meet organizational uptime requirements.<br>Which workflow will meet these requirements in an automated manner?<br>

            A company must deploy multiple independent instances of an application. The front-end application is internet accessible. However, corporate policy stipulates that the backends are to be isolated from each other and the internet, yet accessible from a centralized administration server. The application setup should be automated to minimize the opportunity for mistakes as new instances are deployed.<br>Which option meets the requirements and MINIMIZES costs?<br>

            A company deployed a three-tier web application in two regions: us-east-1 and eu-west-1. The application must be active in both regions at the same time. The database tier of the application uses a single Amazon RDS Aurora database globally, with a master in us-east-1 and a read replica in eu-west-1. Both regions are connected by a VPN.<br>The company wants to ensure that the application remains available even in the event of a region-level failure of all of the application's components. It is acceptable for the application to be in read-only mode for up to 1 hour. The company plans to configure two Amazon Route 53 record sets, one for each of the regions.<br>How should the company complete the configuration to meet its requirements while providing the lowest latency for the application end-users?

            A company has a requirement that only allows specially hardened AMIs to be launched into public subnets in a VPC, and for the AMIs to be associated with a specific security group. Allowing non-compliant instances to launch into the public subnet could present a significant security risk if they are allowed to operate.<br>A mapping of approved AMIs to subnets to security groups exists in an Amazon DynamoDB table in the same AWS account. The company created an AWS<br>Lambda function that, when invoked, will terminate a given Amazon EC2 instance if the combination of AMI, subnet, and security group are not approved in the<br>DynamoDB table.<br>What should the Solutions Architect do to MOST quickly mitigate the risk of compliance deviations?<br>

            A company runs its containerized batch jobs on Amazon ECS. The jobs are scheduled by submitting a container image, a task definition, and the relevant data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Container images may be unique per job. Running the jobs as quickly as possible is of utmost importance, so submitting jobs artifacts to the S3 bucket triggers the job to run immediately. Sometimes there may no jobs running at all. However, jobs of any size can be submitted with no prior warning to the IT Operations team. Job definitions include CPU and memory resource requirements.<br>What solution will allow the batch jobs to complete as quickly as possible after being scheduled?<br>

            An auction website enables users to bid on collectible items. The auction rules require that each bid is processed only once and in the order it was received. The current implementation is based on a fleet of Amazon EC2 web servers that write bid records into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. A single t2.large instance has a cron job that runs the bid processor, which reads incoming bids from Kinesis Data Streams and processes each bid. The auction site is growing in popularity, but users are complaining that some bids are not registering.<br>Troubleshooting indicates that the bid processor is too slow during peak demand hours, sometimes crashes while processing, and occasionally loses track of which records is being processed.<br>What changes should make the bid processing more reliable?<br>
        </p>

                            </span>

                            Refactor the web application to use the Amazon Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) when posting bids to Kinesis Data Streams. Refactor the bid processor to flag each record in Kinesis Data Streams as being unread, processing, and processed. At the start of each bid processing run, scan Kinesis Data Streams for unprocessed records.

                            Refactor the web application to post each incoming bid to an Amazon SNS topic in place of Kinesis Data Streams. Configure the SNS topic to trigger an AWS Lambda function that processes each bid as soon as a user submits it.

                        <li class="multi-choice-item">

                            </span>

                            Refactor the web application to post each incoming bid to an Amazon SQS FIFO queue in place of Kinesis Data Streams. Refactor the bid processor to continuously the SQS queue. Place the bid processing EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and a maximum size of 1.

                            Switch the EC2 instance type from t2.large to a larger general compute instance type. Put the bid processor EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that scales out the number of EC2 instances running the bid processor, based on the IncomingRecords metric in Kinesis Data Streams.

            A public retail web application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of Amazon EC2 instances running across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in a<br>Region backed by an Amazon RDS MySQL Multi-AZ deployment. Target group health checks are configured to use HTTP and pointed at the product catalog page. Auto Scaling is configured to maintain the web fleet size based on the ALB health check.<br>Recently, the application experienced an outage. Auto Scaling continuously replaced the instances during the outage. A subsequent investigation determined that the web server metrics were within the normal range, but the database tier was experiencing high load, resulting in severely elevated query response times.<br>Which of the following changes together would remediate these issues while improving monitoring capabilities for the availability and functionality of the entire application stack for future growth?

            A company wants to manage the costs associated with a group of 20 applications that are critical, by migrating to AWS. The applications are a mix of Java and<br>Node.js spread across different instance clusters. The company wants to minimize costs while standardizing by using a single deployment methodology. Most of the applications are part of month-end processing routines with a small number of concurrent users, but they are occasionally run at other times. Average application memory consumption is less than 1 GB, though some applications use as much as 2.5 GB of memory during peak processing. The most important application in the group is a billing report written in Java that accesses multiple data sources and often for several hours.<br>Which is the MOST cost-effective solution?<br>

The database server has a 100 GB memory requirement. The business requires cost-efficient disaster recovery for the application with an RTO of 5 minutes and an RPO of 1 hour. The business also has a regulatory for out-of region disaster recovery with a minimum distance between the primary and alternate sites of 250 miles.<br>Which of the following options can the Solutions Architect design to create a comprehensive solution for this customer that meets the disaster recovery requirements?<br>

                            Back up the application and database data frequently and copy them to Amazon S3. Replicate the backups using S3 cross-region replication, and use AWS CloudFormation to instantiate infrastructure for disaster recovery and restore data from Amazon S3.

                            Employ a pilot light environment in which the primary database is configured with mirroring to build a standby database on m4.large in the alternate region. Use AWS CloudFormation to instantiate the web servers, application servers and load balancers in case of a disaster to bring the application up in the alternate region. Vertically resize the database to meet the full production demands, and use Amazon Route 53 to switch traffic to the alternate region.

                            Use a scaled-down version of the fully functional production environment in the alternate region that includes one instance of the web server, one instance of the application server, and a replicated instance of the database server in standby mode. Place the web and the application tiers in an Auto Scaling behind a load balancer, which can automatically scale when the load arrives to the application. Use Amazon Route 53 to switch traffic to the alternate region.

                            Employ a multi-region solution with fully functional web, application, and database tiers in both regions with equivalent capacity. Activate the primary database in one region only and the standby database in the other region. Use Amazon Route 53 to automatically switch traffic from one region to another using health check routing policies.

            A company runs a memory-intensive analytics application using on-demand Amazon EC2 C5 compute optimized instance. The application is used continuously and application demand doubles during working hours. The application currently scales based on CPU usage. When scaling in occurs, a lifecycle hook is used because the instance requires 4 minutes to clean the application state before terminating.<br>Because users reported poor performance during working hours, scheduled scaling actions were implemented so additional instances would be added during working hours. The Solutions Architect has been asked to reduce the cost of the application.<br>Which solution is MOST cost-effective?<br>

            A company has a website that enables users to upload videos. Company policy states the uploaded videos must be analyzed for restricted content. An uploaded video is placed in Amazon S3, and a message is pushed to an Amazon SQS queue with the video's location. A backend application pulls this location from<br>Amazon SQS and analyzes the video.<br>The video analysis is compute-intensive and occurs sporadically during the day. The website scales with demand. The video analysis application runs on a fixed number of instances. Peak demand occurs during the holidays, so the company must add instances to the application during this time. All instances used are currently on-demand Amazon EC2 T2 instances. The company wants to reduce the cost of the current solution.<br>Which of the following solutions is MOST cost-effective?<br>

            A company wants to manage the costs associated with a group of 20 applications that are critical, by migrating to AWS. The applications are a mix of Java and<br>Node.js spread across different instance clusters. The company wants to minimize costs while standardizing by using a single deployment methodology. Most of the applications are part of month-end processing routines with a small number of concurrent users, but they are occasionally run at other times. Average application memory consumption is less than 1 GB, though some applications use as much as 2.5 GB of memory during peak processing. The most important application in the group is a billing report written in Java that accesses multiple data sources and often for several hours.<br>Which is the MOST cost-effective solution?<br>

The database tier is an Amazon RDS MySQL Multi-AZ instance. The entire application stack is deployed in both us-east-1 and eu-central-1. Amazon Route 53 is used to route traffic to the two installations using a latency-based routing policy. A weighted routing policy is configured in Route 53 as a fail over to another region in case the installation in a region becomes unresponsive.<br>During the testing of disaster recovery scenarios, after blocking access to the Amazon RDS MySQL instance in eu-central-1 from all the application instances running in that region.

            An online e-commerce business is running a workload on AWS. The application architecture includes a web tier, an application tier for business logic, and a database tier for user and transactional data management. The database server has a 100 GB memory requirement. The business requires cost-efficient disaster recovery for the application with an RTO of 5 minutes and an RPO of 1 hour. The business also has a regulatory for out-of region disaster recovery with a minimum distance between the primary and alternate sites of 250 miles.<br>Which of the following options can the Solutions Architect design to create a comprehensive solution for this customer that meets the disaster recovery requirements?<br>

                            Back up the application and database data frequently and copy them to Amazon S3. Replicate the backups using S3 cross-region replication, and use AWS CloudFormation to instantiate infrastructure for disaster recovery and restore data from Amazon S3.

                            Employ a pilot light environment in which the primary database is configured with mirroring to build a standby database on m4.large in the alternate region. Use AWS CloudFormation to instantiate the web servers, application servers and load balancers in case of a disaster to bring the application up in the alternate region. Vertically resize the database to meet the full production demands, and use Amazon Route 53 to switch traffic to the alternate region.

                            </span>

                            Use a scaled-down version of the fully functional production environment in the alternate region that includes one instance of the web server, one instance of the application server, and a replicated instance of the database server in standby mode. Place the web and the application tiers in an Auto Scaling behind a load balancer, which can automatically scale when the load arrives to the application. Use Amazon Route 53 to switch traffic to the alternate region.

                            Employ a multi-region solution with fully functional web, application, and database tiers in both regions with equivalent capacity. Activate the primary database in one region only and the standby database in the other region. Use Amazon Route 53 to automatically switch traffic from one region to another using health check routing policies.

            A company runs a memory-intensive analytics application using on-demand Amazon EC2 C5 compute optimized instance. The application is used continuously and application demand doubles during working hours. The application currently scales based on CPU usage. When scaling in occurs, a lifecycle hook is used because the instance requires 4 minutes to clean the application state before terminating.<br>Because users reported poor performance during working hours, scheduled scaling actions were implemented so additional instances would be added during working hours. The Solutions Architect has been asked to reduce the cost of the application.<br>Which solution is MOST cost-effective?<br>

            A Solutions Architect is responsible for redesigning a legacy Java application to improve its availability, data durability, and scalability. Currently, the application runs on a single high-memory Amazon EC2 instance. It accepts HTTP requests from upstream clients, adds them to an in-memory queue, and responds with a<br>200 status. A separate application thread reads items from the queue, processes them, and persists the results to an Amazon RDS MySQL instance. The processing time for each item takes 90 seconds on average., most of which is spent waiting on external service calls, but the application is written to process multiple items in parallel.<br>Traffic to this service is unpredictable. During periods of high load, items may sit in the internal queue for over an hour while the application processes the backing.<br>In addition, the current system has issues with availability and data if the single application node fails.<br>Clients that access this service cannot be modified. They expect to receive a response to each HTTP request they send within 10 seconds before they will time out and retry the request.<br>Which approach would improve the availability and durability of the system while decreasing the processing latency and minimizing costs?<br>

            A Solutions Architect needs to migrate a legacy application from on premises to AWS. On premises, the application runs on two Linux servers behind a load balancer and accesses a database that is master-master on two servers. Each application server requires a license file that is tied to the MAC address of the server's network adapter. It takes the software vendor 12 hours to send ne license files through email. The application requires configuration files to use static.<br>IPv4 addresses to access the database servers, not DNS.<br>Given these requirements, which steps should be taken together to enable a scalable architecture for the application servers?

            A company has a website that enables users to upload videos. Company policy states the uploaded videos must be analyzed for restricted content. An uploaded video is placed in Amazon S3, and a message is pushed to an Amazon SQS queue with the video's location. A backend application pulls this location from<br>Amazon SQS and analyzes the video.<br>The video analysis is compute-intensive and occurs sporadically during the day. The website scales with demand. The video analysis application runs on a fixed number of instances. Peak demand occurs during the holidays, so the company must add instances to the application during this time. All instances used are currently on-demand Amazon EC2 T2 instances. The company wants to reduce the cost of the current solution.<br>Which of the following solutions is MOST cost-effective?<br>

            A mobile gaming application publishes data continuously to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. An AWS Lambda function processes records from the data stream and writes to an Amazon DynamoDB table.

The company notices the<br>GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds metric of the Kinesis data stream temporarily spikes to over a minute for several minutes. The AWS Lambda function writes<br>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException messages to Amazon CloudWatch Logs during these times, and some records are redirected to the dead letter queue.<br>No exceptions are thrown by the Kinesis producer on the gaming application.<br>What change should the company make to resolve this issue?<br>

                            Use Application Auto Scaling to set a scaling schedule to scale out write capacity on the DynamoDB table during predictable load spikes.

            While debugging a backend application for an IoT system that supports globally distributed devices, a Solutions Architect notices that stale data is occasionally being sent to user devices. Devices often share data, and stale data does not cause issues in most cases. However, device operations are disrupted when a device reads the stale data after an update.<br>The global system has multiple identical application stacks deployed in different AWS Regions. If a user device travels out of its home geographic region, it will always connect to the geographically closest AWS Region to write or read data. The same data is available in all supported AWS Regions using an Amazon<br>DynamoDB global table.<br>What change should be made to avoid causing disruptions in device operations?<br>

            A software as a service (SaaS) company offers a cloud solution for document management to private law firms and the public sector. A local government client recently mandated that highly confidential documents cannot be stored outside the country. The company CIO asks a Solutions Architect to ensure the application can adapt to this new requirement. The CIO also wants to have a proper backup plan for these documents, as backups are not currently performed.<br>What solution meets these requirements?<br>

            A company is having issues with a newly deployed serverless infrastructure that uses Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB.<br>In a steady state, the application performs as expected. However, during peak load, tens of thousands of simultaneous invocations are needed and user requests fail multiple times before succeeding. The company has checked the logs for each component, focusing specifically on Amazon CloudWatch Logs for Lambda.<br>There are no errors logged by the services or applications.<br>What might cause this problem?<br>
        </p>


            <div class="question-choices-container">

                            </span>

                            Lambda has very low memory assigned, which causes the function to fail at peak load.
                        </li>

                        <li class="multi-choice-item">

                            </span>

                            Lambda is in a subnet that uses a NAT gateway to reach out of the internet, and the function instance does not have sufficient Amazon EC2 resources in the VPC to scale with the load.

                            </span>

                            The throttle limit set on API Gateway is very low. During peak load, the additional requests are not making their way through to Lambda.

                            </span>

                            DynamoDB is set up in an auto scaling mode. During peak load, DynamoDB adjusts capacity and throughput behind the scenes, which is causing the temporary downtime. Once the scaling completes, the retries go through successfully.

            A company is operating a large customer service call center, and stores and processes call recordings with a custom application. Approximately 2% of the call recordings are transcribed by an offshore team for quality assurance purposes. These recordings take up to 72 hours to be transcribed. The recordings are stored on an NFS share before they are archived to an offsite location after 90 days. The company uses Linux servers for processing the call recordings and managing the transcription queue. There is also a web application for the quality assurance staff to review and score call recordings.<br>The company plans to migrate the system to AWS to reduce storage costs and the time required to transcribe calls.<br>Which set of actions should be taken to meet the company's objectives?<br>

            A company is hosting a three-tier web application in an on-premises environment. Due to a recent surge in traffic that resulted in downtime and a significant financial impact, company management has ordered that the application be moved to AWS. The application is written in .NET and has a dependency on a MySQL database. A solutions architect must design a scalable and highly available solution to meet the demand of 200,000 daily users.<br>Which steps should the solutions architect take to design an appropriate solution?<br>

                            Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to create a new application with a web server environment and an Amazon RDS MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance. The environment should launch a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in multiple Availability Zones. Use an Amazon Route 53 alias record to route traffic from the company's domain to the NLB.

            A company currently has data hosted in an IBM Db2 database. A web application calls an API that runs stored procedures on the database to retrieve user information data that is read-only. This data is historical in nature and changes on a daily basis. When a user logs in to the application, this data needs to be retrieved within 3 seconds. Each time a user logs in, the stored procedures run. Users log in several times a day to check stock prices.<br>Running this database has become cost-prohibitive due to Db2 CPU licensing. Performance goals are not being met. Timeouts from Db2 are common due to long-running queries.<br>Which approach should a solutions architect take to migrate this solution to AWS?<br>

            An enterprise company's data science team wants to provide a safe, cost-effective way to provide easy access to Amazon SageMaker. The data scientists have limited AWS knowledge and need to be able to launch a Jupyter notebook instance. The notebook instance needs to have a preconfigured AWS KMS key to encrypt data at rest on the machine learning storage volume without exposing the complex setup requirements.<br>Which approach will allow the company to set up a self-service mechanism for the data scientists to launch Jupyter notebooks in its AWS accounts with the<br>LEAST amount of operational overhead?<br>

            A company has built a high performance computing (HPC) cluster in AWS for a tightly coupled workload that generates a large number of shared files stored in<br>Amazon EFS. The cluster was performing well when the number of Amazon EC2 instances in the cluster was 100. However, when the company increased the cluster size to 1,000 EC2 instances, overall performance was well below expectations.<br>Which collection of design choices should a solutions architect make to achieve the maximum performance from the HPC cluster? (Choose three.)<br>

            A company needs to move its on-premises resources to AWS. The current environment consists of 100 virtual machines (VMs) with a total of 40 TB of storage.<br>Most of the VMs can be taken offline because they support functions during business hours only, however, some are mission critical, so downtime must be minimized.<br>The administrator of the on-premises network provisioned 10 Mbps of internet bandwidth for the migration. The on-premises network throughput has reached capacity and would be costly to increase. A solutions architect must design a migration solution that can be performed within the next 3 months.<br>Which method would fulfill these requirements?<br>

            A company has an internal application running on AWS that is used to track and process shipments in the company's warehouse. Currently, after the system receives an order, it emails the staff the information needed to ship a package. Once the package is shipped, the staff replies to the email and the order is marked as shipped.<br>The company wants to stop using email in the application and move to a serverless application model.<br>Which architecture solution meets these requirements?<br>

                            Use AWS Batch to configure the different tasks required to ship a package. Have AWS Batch trigger an AWS Lambda function that creates and prints a shipping label. Once that label is scanned, as it leaves the warehouse, have another Lambda function move the process to the next step in the AWS Batch job.

                            Update the application to store new order information in Amazon DynamoDB. When a new order is created, trigger an AWS Step Functions workflow, mark the orders as "in progress", and print a package label to the warehouse. Once the label has been scanned and fulfilled, the application will trigger an AWS Lambda function that will mark the order as shipped and complete the workflow.

            A company has developed a mobile game. The backend for the game runs on several virtual machines located in an on-premises data center. The business logic is exposed using a REST API with multiple functions. Player session data is stored in central file storage. Backend services use different API keys for throttling and to distinguish between live and test traffic.<br>The load on the game backend varies throughout the day. During peak hours, the server capacity is not sufficient. There are also latency issues when fetching player session data. Management has asked a solutions architect to present a cloud architecture that can handle the game's varying load and provide low-latency data access. The API model should not be changed.<br>Which solution meets these requirements?<br>

            A solutions architect is designing the data storage and retrieval architecture for a new application that a company will be launching soon. The application is designed to ingest millions of small records per minute from devices all around the world. Each record is less than 4 KB in size and needs to be stored in a durable location where it can be retrieved with low latency. The data is ephemeral and the company is required to store the data for 120 days only, after which the data can be deleted.<br>The solutions architect calculates that, during the course of year, the storage requirements would be about 10-15 TB.<br>Which storage strategy is the MOST cost-effective and meets the design requirements?<br>
